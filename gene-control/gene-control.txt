To my mother and in memory of my father

Preface
It is now 25 years since the first edition of my book Gene Regulation: A
Eukaryotic Perspective was published. Subsequently, four further editions
appeared reflecting the enormous advances in the field over the ensuing
years. By 2010, these advances allowed both a mechanistic understanding
of the processes involved in gene regulation and a detailed analysis of the
manner in which they operate in specific biological systems.
The work was therefore significantly expanded and revised to reflect these
changes and given a new title, Gene Control. In the last few years, the field
has developed further, necessitating this second and revised edition of Gene
Control.
In particular, our understanding of two major themes in gene regulation
has advanced considerably in the last few years and this is reflected in this
new edition. The first of these is the regulation of chromatin structure and
its role in gene regulation. Although a chapter was devoted to this topic in
the first edition of Gene Regulation, its role was much less well understood
at that time than, for example, that of DNA-binding transcription factors.
However, over the last 25 years this topic has assumed a central position in
our understanding of gene regulation. It is now clear, for example, that as
well as the genomic DNA sequence, there exists an epigenome (‘epi’ is
Greek for ‘on’) involving modifications of the DNA and of the proteins, such
as histones, associated with it. Moreover, this epigenome varies between
different tissues and cell types in contrast to the relative invariance of the
genomic DNA sequence. This allows the epigenome to play a key role in the
regulation of gene expression. To reflect this, all the sections dealing with
this topic have been extensively revised and updated, while the title of
Chapter 3 has been changed to ‘The Epigenome: Role of Chromatin
Structure in Gene Control.’ Moreover, additional sections have been added
on these modifications as a target of cellular signaling pathways (Section
8.5) and on the role of the epigenome in cancer (Section 11.4) and other
human diseases (Section 12.2).
The second major area to have advanced hugely in recent years is that of
regulatory RNAs. At the time the first edition of Gene Regulation was published, it was believed that the regulation of gene expression was produced
exclusively by regulatory proteins and the possibility of regulatory RNAs had
not been put forward. It is now clear, however, that such regulatory RNAs
are as important in the regulation of gene expression as regulatory proteins.
Moreover, although small regulatory RNAs (20–30 bases in length) were discussed in the first edition of Gene Control, further studies have now indicated that longer regulatory RNAs (200 bases or more in length) are also of
critical importance in the regulation of gene expression. Accordingly, the
sections of this book dealing with this area have been updated and expanded
to reflect the key role of all types of regulatory RNAs and to give equal
emphasis to the different classes of such RNAs. Moreover, additional sections have been added on the role of regulatory RNAs in cancer (Section
11.6) and other human diseases (Section 12.4).
As with the first edition, the second edition of Gene Control is organized into
two parts. The first part provides a detailed mechanistic analysis of the processes involved in controlling gene expression. After an introductory chapter, three pairs of chapters deal with the fundamental processes involved in
gene regulation. In each pair of chapters, the first chapter deals with the
basic process itself and the second deals with the manner in which it is
involved in regulating gene expression. Thus, Chapters 2 and 3 deal with
chromatin structure and its role in gene regulation, Chapters 4 and 5 deal
with the process of transcription itself and the manner in which it is

viii

regulated, while Chapters 6 and 7 deal with post-transcriptional processes
and their role in the regulation of gene expression.
In contrast, the second part of the book deals with specific biological processes and the role played by gene control in their regulation. Thus, Chapter
8 deals with cellular signaling processes, Chapter 9 deals with the regulation of gene expression in development and Chapter 10 discusses the key
role played by gene regulatory processes in the specification of individual
differentiated cell types. Finally, Chapters 11 and 12 deal with the alterations in gene expression that can cause specific human diseases. Thus,
Chapter 11 discusses the role of gene regulation in cancer while Chapter 12
deals with gene regulation in inherited and infectious diseases of humans,
as well as discussing the manner in which advances in our understanding
of gene regulatory processes may lead to improved therapies for human
diseases.
Overall therefore it is hoped that the significant revision and updating of
this book will allow it to continue to be of value to students, scientists, and
clinicians interested in the topic of gene control, which is of such vital
importance in both normal development and the proper functioning of the
adult organism as well as playing a critical role in the development of different human diseases.
Finally, I should like to thank the staff of Garland Science who have produced this book so efficiently, particularly Elizabeth Owen who originally
suggested the restructuring/expansion of this book, as well as being a valuable source of advice throughout the preparation of both editions. As
always, I am indebted to Maruschka Malacos who has coped most efficiently with the need to introduce considerable new material as well as to
rearrange and modify existing material in the preparation of the new
edition.

4.1

Transcription by RNA polymerases 115
Transcription by RNA polymerase I is
relatively simple
Transcription by RNA polymerase III
is more complex than for RNA
polymerase I
Transcription by RNA polymerase II
is much more complex than
transcription by RNA polymerases I
and III

116

117

119

Polymerase pausing is widespread
and represents a potential control
point for the regulation of
transcription

130

Termination of transcription occurs
downstream of the polyadenylation
signal

131

4.3 The gene promoter

134

The 70 kDa heat-shock protein gene
contains a typical promoter for RNA
polymerase II

135

The hsp70 gene promoter contains
several DNA sequence motifs which
are found in a variety of other gene
promoters

135

The heat-shock element is found
only in heat-inducible genes

136

Other response elements are found
in the promoters of genes with
different patterns of expression

138

The proteins binding to short DNA
sequence elements can be
characterized by a variety
of techniques

140

The use of high-throughput methods
such ChIP-chip and ChIP-seq allows
the analysis of DNA-binding sites and
epigenetic modifications on a whole
genome basis

144

Promoter regulatory elements act by
binding factors which either affect
chromatin structure and/or influence
transcription directly

145

4.4 Enhancers and silencers

146

Enhancers are regulatory sequences
that act at a distance to increase gene
expression

146

122

Transcription by RNA polymerases I, II,
and III has a number of common
features

Many enhancers have cell type- or
tissue-specific activity

148

123

Transcription takes place in defined
regions of the nucleus

127

Enhancers influence transcription
both by recruiting DNA-binding
transcription factors and by altering
chromatin structure

150

4.2 Transcriptional elongation and
termination

129

Transcriptional elongation requires
further phosphorylation of RNA
polymerase II

The “at a distance” action of
enhancers involves both
DNA-binding transcription factors and

159

Introduction

159

5.1 DNA binding by transcription
factors

162

The helix-turn-helix motif is found in a
number of transcription factors which
regulate gene expression during
embryonic development
The helix-turn-helix domain found in
homeodomain proteins is a DNAbinding domain

162

164

In the POU domain transcription
factors, the homeodomain forms
part of a larger DNA-binding motif

166

The two-cysteine–two-histidine zinc
finger is found in multiple copies in
many transcription factors

168

The nuclear receptors contain two
copies of a multi-cysteine zinc finger
distinct from the two-cysteine–twohistidine zinc finger

170

The leucine zipper is a dimerization
domain which allows DNA binding
by the adjacent basic domain

175

In some transcription factors, the
basic DNA-binding domain is found
associated with a helix-loop-helix
dimerization domain
Dimerization between factors
provides an additional level of
regulation
Other domains can also mediate
DNA binding
The DNA sequence bound by a
particular transcription factor
and the effect of such binding is
affected by the presence or absence
of other regulatory factors
5.2 Activation of transcription
Activation domains can be identified
by “domain-swap” experiments

176

xv

Several different classes of activation
domain exist

183

Activators can interact with the TAFs
within the TFIID complex

184

Activators can interact with
modulators of chromatin structure

187

Activators have a multitude of targets

188

5.3 Repression of transcription

190

Repressors can act indirectly by
inhibiting the positive effect
of activators

191

Repressors can act directly by
inhibiting the assembly or activity
of the basal transcriptional complex

191

5.4 Regulation at transcriptional
elongation

194

Regulation of transcription can occur
at the elongation stage, as well as at
initiation

194

Factors which regulate transcriptional
elongation target the C-terminal
domain of the RPB1 subunit of RNA
polymerase II

197

5.5 Regulation of transcription by RNA
polymerases I and III
199
Transcription by RNA polymerases I
and III can be regulated by altering the
expression or activity of components
of their basal transcriptional complexes 199
Regulation of transcription by RNA
polymerase III can involve specific
transcription factors binding to RNA
as well as to DNA

200

Transcription by RNA polymerases I
and III can be regulated by alterations
in chromatin structure

Levels of Gene Control

IntroductIon
The evidence that eukaryotic gene expression must be a highly regulated
process is available to anyone visiting a butcher’s shop. The various parts of
the mammalian body on display differ dramatically in appearance, ranging
from the muscular legs and hind quarters to the soft tissues of the kidneys and
liver. However, all these diverse types of tissues arose from a single cell, the
fertilized egg or zygote, raising the question of how this diversity is achieved.
It is clear that regulatory processes must exist that allow different cells to
form in different places in an orderly manner during embryonic development
and to maintain their differences in the adult organism. Moreover, cells need
to be able to alter their pattern of gene expression in response to changes such
as alterations in the levels of nutrients, growth factors, hormones, etc.. It
is the aim of this book to consider the processes regulating tissue-specific
gene expression in eukaryotes and the manner in which they produce
these differences in the nature and function of different tissues and cell types.

1.1 the proteIn content of dIfferent cell
types Is dIfferent
The fundamental dogma of molecular biology is that DNA produces RNA
which in turn produces proteins. The genetic information in the DNA specifying particular functions is converted into an RNA copy which is then translated into protein. The action of the protein then produces the phenotype,
be it the presence of a functional globin protein transporting oxygen in the
blood or the activity of a proteinaceous enzyme capable of producing the
pigment causing the appearance of brown rather than blue eyes. If the differences in the appearance of tissues described above are indeed caused by
differences in gene expression in different tissues, they should be produced
by differences in the proteins present in these tissues and the cell types of
which they are composed. Such differences can be detected both by specific
methods that study the expression of one particular protein and by general
methods aimed at studying the expression of all proteins in a given tissue.

S
A simple means of determining whether differences in protein composition
exist in different tissues or cell types involves investigating the expression
of individual known proteins in such tissues using a specific antibody to
that protein. Such antibodies can be used in conjunction with the onedimensional polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis technique to investigate
the expression of a particular protein in different tissues. In this technique,
proteins are denatured by treatment with the detergent sodium dodecyl

Chapter 1: Levels of Gene Control

­
Subsequently, in a technique known as Western blotting, the gelseparated proteins are transferred to a nitrocellulose filter which is incubated
with the antibody. The antibody recognizes and binds specifically to the protein against which it is directed. This protein will be present at a particular
position on the filter, dependent on how far it moved in the electrophoresis
step and hence on its size. The binding of the antibody is then visualized by
an enzymatic or fluorescent detection procedure. If a tissue contains the protein of interest, a band will be observed in the track containing total protein
from that tissue and the intensity of the band observed will provide a measure of the amount of protein present in the tissue. If none of the particular
protein is present in a given tissue, no band will form (Figure 1.1).
This method allows the presence or absence of a specific protein in a
particular tissue to be assessed using one-dimensional gel electrophoresis
without the complicating effect of other unrelated proteins of similar size,
since these will fail to bind the antibody. Similarly quantitative differences in
the expression of a particular protein in different tissues can be detected on
the basis of differences in the intensity of the band obtained when extracts
prepared from the different tissues are used in this procedure.
The results of such experiments indicate that while some proteins are
present at similar abundance in all tissues, the abundance of other proteins
varies between different tissues and a large number are specific to one or a
few tissues or cell types. Thus, the differences between different tissues in
appearance and function are correlated with qualitative and quantitative
differences in protein composition, as assayed using antibodies to individual
proteins.

General methods can be used for studying the overall protein
composition of tissues and cells
As well as examining the expression of individual proteins in different tissues, it is also possible to use more general methods to compare the overall
protein composition of different tissues. All the proteins present in a tissue
can be subjected to one-dimensional gel electrophoresis and examined by
using a stain that reacts with all proteins. This method allows the visualization of all cellular proteins separated according to their size on the gel,
rather than using Western blotting with a particular antibody to focus on a
specific protein. However, this method is of relatively limited use to investigate variations in the overall protein content of different tissues. This is
because of the very large number of proteins in the cell and the limited
resolution of the technique, which separates proteins solely on the basis of
their size. For example, two entirely different proteins in two tissues may be
scored as being the same protein simply on the basis of a similarity in size.
A more detailed investigation of the protein composition of different tissues can be achieved by two-dimensional gel electrophoresis. In this procedure (Figure 1.2), proteins are first separated on the basis of differences in
their charge, in a technique known as isoelectric focusing. The separated
proteins, still in the first gel, are subsequently layered on top of an SDSpolyacrylamide gel and separated by electrophoresis according to their size.
Thus, a protein moves to a position determined by both its size and its
charge. The much greater resolution of this method allows a number of
differences in the protein composition of particular tissues to be identified.
Some spots or proteins are found in only one or a few tissues and not in
many others, while others are found at dramatically different abundance in
different tissues (Figure 1.3).
The different appearances of different tissues are paralleled therefore by
both qualitative and quantitative differences in the proteins present in each
tissue. It should be noted, however, that in situations where many proteins
exhibit tissue-specific differences in expression, some proteins can be
shown by two-dimensional gel electrophoresis to be present at similar levels in virtually all tissues. Presumably such so-called housekeeping proteins
are involved in basic metabolic processes common to all cell types.

Early experiments using two-dimensional gel electrophoresis simply
involved examining the patterns of spots generated by different tissues and
describing which spots were present or absent in specific tissues or showed
different intensities in different tissues. More recently however, methods have
been developed that allow the protein responsible for forming a spot of particular interest to be identified and characterized (Figure 1.4). These methods
have allowed the development of a new field of study, known as proteomics,
in which the power of two-dimensional gels to separate a wide range of proteins is combined with the ability to study specific proteins individually.
In these methods, individual spots of interest are excised from the
two-dimensional gel and digested into their constituent peptides using the
proteolytic enzyme, trypsin. The individual peptides from a single protein
spot are then analyzed by mass spectrometry. This can involve both
matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization (MALDI), which allows the
molecular weight of the peptide to be determined, and nanoelectrospray
mass spectrometry, which allows the amino acid sequence of a particular
peptide to be obtained (Figure 1.5). Often these two techniques are performed sequentially in a tandem mass spectrometer, which first determines
the molecular weight of a peptide produced by trypsin digestion and then
fragments it further allowing its sequence to be determined.
This peptide molecular weight and sequence information can then be
used to search databases of known protein sequences that have been
obtained either by direct protein sequencing or more frequently predicted
from the ever expanding amount of DNA sequence information. As trypsin
always cleaves proteins after a lysine or arginine residue, it is possible to
align the peptide sequence against that of a known protein and hence identify the protein responsible for the original spot (Figure 1.5).

In a more recent development of this technique, the two-dimensional
gel electrophoresis step is eliminated. Instead, the initial sample containing
a variety of different proteins is first digested with a protease, such as
trypsin. The resulting highly complex mixture of peptides is then separated
by liquid chromatography into different fractions. Each of these fractions
still contains a mixture of different peptides from a number of different proteins but each fraction is obviously less complex than the original mixture
before fractionation. The individual fractions can therefore be analyzed by
repeated cycles of mass spectrometry to determine the molecular weight
and sequence of individual peptides, as described above (Figure 1.6). In
turn, this will allow identification of proteins and their corresponding peptides which are present at different levels in different biological samples.
Proteomic methods can therefore be used to characterize individual
proteins that show interesting patterns of expression in different tissues or
in response to a specific stimulus or whose expression is altered in a specific disease. Hence they combine the power to look at a wide range of
proteins with the ability to identify an individual protein. In terms of gene

Proteins are produced by the translation of specific messenger RNA molecules on the ribosome (see Chapter 6, Section 6.5). Having established that
quantitative and qualitative differences exist in the protein composition of
different tissues, it is necessary to ask whether such differences are paralleled by tissue-specific differences in the abundance of their corresponding
mRNAs. Although it seems likely that differences in the mRNA populations
of different tissues do indeed underlie the observed tissue-specific differences in proteins, it is possible that all tissues have the same mRNA species
and that production of different proteins is controlled by regulating which of
these are selected by the ribosome to be translated into protein.
As with the study of proteins, both specific and general techniques exist
for studying the mRNAs expressed in a given tissue.

A number of different specific methods exist that can be used to detect and
quantify one specific mRNA, using a cloned DNA probe derived from its
corresponding gene. In one such method, Northern blotting, the RNA
extracted from a particular tissue is electrophoresed on an agarose gel,
transferred to a nitrocellulose filter, and hybridized to a radioactive probe
derived from the gene encoding the mRNA of interest. The presence of the
RNA in a particular tissue will result in hybridization of the radioactive
probe and the visualization of a band on autoradiography, the intensity
of the band being dependent on the amount of RNA present (Figure 1.7).
Although such experiments do detect the RNA encoding some proteins,
such as actin or tubulin, in all tissues, very many others are found only in
one particular tissue. The RNA for the globin protein is found only in reticulocytes, that for myosin only in muscle, while (in the example shown in

Figure 1.7) the mRNA encoding the fetal protein α-fetoprotein is shown to
be present only in the embryonic yolk sac and not in the adult liver.
Similar results can also be obtained using other methods for detecting
specific RNAs in material isolated from different tissues. In particular, many
studies on the expression of individual mRNAs now use the quantitative
reverse transcriptase/polymerase chain reaction technique (qRT/PCR). This
method relies on the use of the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) to specifically amplify small amounts of a particular nucleic acid sequence
(Figure 1.8). As PCR can only be carried out with DNA and not with RNA,
the RNA is first converted into a complementary DNA copy (cDNA) by the
enzyme reverse transcriptase. Subsequently, short oligonucleotide primers, which specifically hybridize to the DNA derived from the RNA of interest, are used to direct its replication by a DNA polymerase enzyme in a
PCR reaction (Figure 1.8). The resulting double-stranded DNA is then melted
into its single-stranded components, allowing further annealing of the
primers and another round of DNA synthesis.
Repeated cycles of amplification, involving melting, primer annealing,
and DNA synthesis, result in a small amount of a specific mRNA/cDNA being
amplified to produce a large amount of product. This method therefore allows
the analysis of very small amounts of mRNA that could not be analyzed by
Northern blotting. Moreover, by comparing the amount of product produced
from different samples at specific numbers of amplification cycles, it is possible to compare the amount of a specific mRNA in each of the samples.
In addition, it is possible to produce standard curves showing the amount
of PCR product produced at different amplification cycles starting with
known quantities of a particular RNA. This allows the amount of that RNA
to be precisely quantified in samples where this is not yet known. This is
achieved by using a standard curve relating the amount of the mRNA present to the amount of PCR product generated at different numbers of amplification cycles (Figure 1.9).

General methods can be used to study the overall population of
mrnas expressed in different tissues and cells
As in the case of proteins, methods for studying individual RNAs can be
supplemented by methods for studying RNA populations. Methods have
been developed that can combine the ability to look at variation in the total
RNA population of different tissues with the ability to look specifically at the
variation in a specific mRNA. By analogy with the proteomic methods which
achieve this at the protein level (see Section 1.1), these methods are often
referred to as transcriptomic methods.
In these methods, so called “gene chips” are prepared in which DNA
sequences derived from thousands of different mRNAs are laid out in a regular array at a density of over 10,000 different DNA sequences per square
centimeter (Figure 1.10). This is achieved either by spotting out cDNA
clones derived from the different mRNAs at high density on a glass slide or
by synthesizing short oligonucleotides derived from each mRNA in situ on
the gene chip.
Once this has been achieved, the gene chips can be hybridized with fluorescent sequences prepared from the total mRNA present in different tissues
and the pattern of hybridization observed (Figure 1.10). Where a specific
mRNA is present in a tissue, it will be present in the fluorescent sequences
and a signal will be obtained on the gene chip with the strength of the signal

being proportional to the amount of the RNA that is present. Similarly, if the
mRNA is absent then it will be absent from the probe and no signal will be
obtained. The very large amount of DNA sequence information that is now
available allows large numbers of DNA sequences derived from individual
genes to be included on the chips, taking advantage of the ability to spot out
many different DNA sequences onto a very small chip. Hence, the expression
of virtually all the mRNAs in a cell can now be compared in different tissues
and cell types or in response to specific stimuli (Figure 1.11).
This very powerful method allows the expression profile of individual
tissues and cell types to be obtained and compared. The use of this
method has provided further support for the conclusion that the mRNA
populations of different tissues show both qualitative and quantitative
differences.
Both methods that look at individual mRNAs and transcriptomic methods clearly demonstrate that the qualitative and quantitative variation in
protein composition between different tissues and cell types is paralleled
by a similar variation in the nature of the mRNA species present in different tissues. Indeed, in a study of a wide range of yeast proteins and
mRNAs, the abundance of an individual protein, determined by twodimensional gel electrophoresis, generally correlated well with the abundance of the corresponding mRNA, determined by a gene chip approach.
A similar correlation has also been observed in a survey of human liver
mRNAs and proteins. Moreover, although the levels of many different
mRNAs do vary between different tissues, the mRNAs expressing so-called
housekeeping proteins are frequently present at the same level in different
tissues, paralleling the similar levels of these proteins in different tissues
(see Section 1.1).
Thus, the production of different proteins by different tissues is primarily
regulated by controlling the population of mRNAs that are present in each
tissue rather than by selecting which mRNAs are translated by the ribosome.
However, examples of regulated mRNA translation do exist in a number of
different situations and these will be discussed in Chapter 7, Section 7.7.

The DNA content of different cell types is generally the same

1.3 the dna content of dIfferent cell types
Is Generally the same
Having established that the RNA and protein content of different cell types
show considerable variation, the fundamental dogma of molecular biology
in which DNA makes RNA which in turn makes protein, directs us to consider whether such variation is caused by differences in the DNA present in
each tissue. In theory, DNA which corresponded to an RNA required in one
particular tissue only, might be discarded in all other tissues (Figure 1.12a).
Alternatively, it might be activated in the tissue where RNA was required by
a selective increase in its copy number in the genome via an amplification
event (Figure 1.12b) or by some rearrangement of the DNA necessary for
its activation (Figure 1.12c).
It is clear however, that in general these mechanisms do not operate to
regulate gene expression. The DNA content of different tissues and cell
types is normally the same with its differential expression to produce different mRNA populations in different cell types being the primary control
point regulating gene expression (Figure 1.12d). As with the studies of
protein (Section 1.1) and RNA (Section 1.2) content, the evidence for this
comes both from methods studying individual genes and from methods
studying the entire genome in different cell types. These will be discussed
in turn.

S
In the same way that individual proteins and RNAs can be studied by
Western blotting and Northern blotting, respectively, the structure of individual genes in different cell types can be studied by Southern blotting.
This is the original blotting technique, first described by Ed Southern in
1975, with the other techniques being subsequently named on the basis of
the different points of the compass! (Methods Box 1.1, Figure 1.13).
Southern blotting can therefore be used to compare the structure of a
particular gene in tissues where it is expressed with that in tissues where it
is not expressed. When this is done, in the vast majority of cases no difference is detected (Figure 1.14). Specific DNA bands produced by a particular gene are not lost in tissues where the gene is not expressed, as expected
on a DNA loss model. Similarly, the bands do not become more intense in

The conclusions based on Southern blotting of individual genes can be progressively extended as more and more genes and the entire human genome
are analyzed by DNA sequencing using DNA isolated from different tissues
and cell types. These whole genome results support those based on individual genes. In general, there is no evidence for DNA sequence changes when
specific genes or chromosomal regions are compared in different cell types.
These techniques would detect even single base changes and therefore represent a clear proof that the DNA content of different tissues and cell types
is generally the same.

These conclusions from molecular biology experiments such as Southern
blotting and DNA sequencing are complemented by functional studies
which show that a whole new organism can be produced from a single differentiated cell. This would be difficult or impossible if specific DNA changes
occur during the process of cell differentiation. For example, if the genes
required for cell types such as muscle and brain are lost in the development
of the intestine, it would not be possible for a differentiated intestinal cell to
give rise to all the differentiated cell types in the adult organism, including
muscle and brain. In fact, such totipotency of differentiated cells has been
observed in both animals and plants.
In plants, the production of a whole organism from a single differentiated cell has been achieved in several species, including both the carrot and
tobacco plants. In the carrot for example, regeneration can occur from a
single differentiated phloem cell, which forms part of the tubing system
through which nutrients are transported in the plant. If a piece of root tissue
is placed in culture (Figure 1.15), single quiescent cells of the phloem can
be stimulated to grow and divide and an undifferentiated callus-type tissue
forms. The disorganized cell mass can be maintained in culture indefinitely
but if the medium is suitably supplemented at various stages, embryonic
development will occur and eventually result in a fully functional flowering
plant containing all the differentiated cell types and tissues normally present. The plant that forms is fertile and cannot be distinguished from a plant
produced by normal biological processes.
The ability to regenerate a functional plant from fully differentiated
cells eliminates the possibility that genes required in other cell types are
lost in the course of plant development. It is noteworthy however, that one
differentiated cell type does not transmute directly into another, rather a
transitional state of undifferentiated proliferating cells serves as an intermediate. Although differentiation does not apparently involve permanent
irreversible changes in the DNA, it does appear to be relatively stable and,
although reversible, requires an intermediate stage for changes to occur.
This semi-stability of cellular differentiation will be discussed further in
Chapter 3.
Although no complex animal has been regenerated by culturing a single
differentiated cell in the manner used for plants, other techniques have
been used to show that differentiated cell nuclei are capable of giving rise
to very many different cell types. These experiments involve the use of
nuclear transplantation (Figure 1.16). In this technique the nucleus of
an unfertilized frog egg is destroyed, either surgically or by irradiation with

ultraviolet light, and a donor nucleus from a differentiated cell of a genetically distinguishable strain of frog is implanted. Development is then
allowed to proceed to test whether, in the environment of the egg cytoplasm, the genetic information in the nucleus of the differentiated cell can
produce an adult frog.
In experiments carried out by Gurdon in which the donor nucleus was
derived, for example, from differentiated intestinal epithelial cells of a tadpole, an adult frog was indeed produced in a small proportion of cases
(about 2%) and development to at least a normal swimming tadpole
occurred in about 20% of cases, with the resulting organisms having the
genetic characteristics of the donor nucleus. Such successful development
supported by the nucleus of a differentiated frog cell is not unique to intestinal cells and has been achieved with the nuclei of other cell types, such as
the skin cells of an adult frog. Although these experiments are technically
difficult and have a high failure rate, it is therefore possible for the nuclei of
differentiated cells to produce organisms containing a range of different cell
types and which are perfectly normal and fertile.
These experiments, which were carried out in amphibia 50 years ago,
were recognized in 2012 by the award of the Nobel Prize to John Gurdon.
Interestingly, it was only many years later that similar experiments were
successfully performed in mammals. In 1997 Wilmut and co-workers
reported experiments in which a donor nucleus derived from a mammary
gland of a 6-year-old sheep was introduced into an unfertilized egg whose
own nucleus had been destroyed. In this manner, they produced an adult
sheep (Dolly) which, as in Gurdon’s experiments with frogs, had the genetic
characteristics of the sheep from which the mammary gland cell nucleus
had been derived (Figure 1.17c). Similar “cloning” experiments have now
been successfully carried out in several other mammalian species including
mice (Figure 1.17a and b) and pigs.
Although these studies have provoked considerable ethical discussion
on the potential cloning of humans, their relevance for the area of gene regulation is that they indicate that in mammals, as in amphibia, a nucleus from
an adult differentiated cell is capable of supporting embryonic development
and producing the full range of cell types present in an adult organism.
These experiments show that the nuclei of individual differentiated animal and plant cells are totipotent and can regenerate an adult organism.
These functional studies therefore reinforce molecular methods in indicating that irreversible changes to the DNA do not occur as a general mechanism for gene control during differentiation. This indicates that the model of
differential expression of the DNA to produce different mRNA populations in
different tissues (see Figure 1.12d) is the correct one. The mechanism of
such differential expression is discussed in Section 1.4.

Although DNA changes are not a general mechanism of gene control, they
do occur in particular specialized cases. We will now discuss one case each
of DNA loss, DNA amplification, and DNA rearrangement to indicate particularly why such cases appear to be due to the specialized requirements
of the particular situation.

Extrusion of the nucleus

(a) dna loss
The best known case of DNA loss is in the development of the mammalian
red blood cell, a highly specialized cell containing large amounts of the
blood pigment hemoglobin which functions in the transport of oxygen in
the blood. During the differentiation of red blood cells the region of the cell
containing the nucleus is pinched off surrounded by a region of the cell
membrane and is eventually destroyed (Figure 1.18).
The resulting cell, known as the reticulocyte, is entirely anucleate and
completely lacks DNA. However, it continues synthesis of large amounts of
globin (the protein part of the hemoglobin molecule), as well as small
amounts of other reticulocyte proteins, by repeated translation of messenger RNA molecules produced in red blood cell precursors before the loss of
the nucleus. Such RNA molecules must therefore be highly stable and
resistant to degradation. Eventually, however, other cytoplasmic components (including ribosomes) are lost, protein synthesis ceases, and the cell
assumes the characteristic structure of the erythrocyte, which is essentially a bag full of oxygen-transporting hemoglobin molecules.
Although this process offers an example of DNA loss during differentiation, it is clearly a highly specialized case in which the loss of the nucleus is
primarily intended to allow the cell to fill up with hemoglobin and to assume
a shape facilitating oxygen uptake, rather than as a means of gene control.
The genes for globin and other reticulocyte proteins are not selectively
retained but are lost with the rest of the nuclear DNA (Figure 1.19). The
tissue-specific pattern of protein synthesis observed in the reticulocyte is
therefore achieved not by selective gene loss but by the processes which
earlier in development, resulted in high-level transcription of the globin
genes and the production of long-lived, stable globin messenger RNA
molecules.

(b) dna amplification
In the case of red blood cells, DNA loss represents a response to the specialized role of the cell rather than a mechanism of gene control. A similar
conclusion can be reached in cases of gene amplification. These occur in
situations where a very high level of mRNA/protein production is required
in a short time such that a single copy of a gene could not produce enough
mRNA/protein.
One such case involves the genes encoding the eggshell or chorion proteins in Drosophila melanogaster. The chorion genes are selectively
amplified (up to 64 times) in the DNA of the cells that surround the egg

follicle, allowing the synthesis in these cells of the large amounts of chorion
mRNA and protein needed to construct the eggshell. Such amplification can
be observed readily in a Southern blot experiment using a recombinant
DNA probe derived from one of the chorion genes (Figure 1.20).
Although this amplification event is part of normal embryonic development, it appears to be a response to a very specialized set of circumstances,
requiring a novel means of gene regulation. Eggshell construction in
Drosophila occurs over a very short period (about 5 hours) and necessitates
the synthesis of mRNA for the chorion proteins at very high rates, too high
to be achieved by transcription of a single unique gene.
It is this combination of high-level synthesis and a very short period to
achieve it that necessitates the use of gene amplification. The very short
time period makes it impossible to produce the high levels of protein
required by use of a highly stable mRNA, as occurs in the globin case (see
above) where high levels of protein are required but over a much longer
time period.

(c) dna rearrangement
When mammals are exposed to foreign bacteria or viruses, their immune
systems respond by synthesizing specific antibodies directed against the
proteins of these organisms with the aim of neutralizing the harmful effects
of the infection. The requirement for the synthesis of diverse kinds of antibody by the mammalian immune system is obviously vast. The body must
be able to defend itself, for example, against a bewildering variety of challenges from infectious organisms by the production of specific antibodies
against their proteins.
These antibodies or immunoglobulins are produced by the covalent
association of two identical heavy chains and two identical light chains
to produce a functional molecule. The combination of specific heavy and
light chains produces the specificity of the antibody molecule. Each immunoglobulin chain contains, in addition to a constant region (which is relatively similar in different antibody molecules), a highly variable region,
which differs widely in amino acid sequence in different antibodies. It is this
variable region that actually interacts with the antigen and determines the
specificity of the antibody molecule.
As any heavy chain can associate with any light chain and as approximately 1 million types of antibody specificities can be produced, at least
1000 genes encoding different heavy chains and a similar number encoding
the light chains would be required. Copy number studies have shown however, that the germ line does not contain anything like this number of intact
immunoglobulin genes and no specific amplification events have been
detected in the DNA of antibody-producing B cells.
Rather, functional immunoglobulin genes are created by DNA rearrangements in the B-cell lineage. The germ-line DNA contains a large number of tandemly repeated DNA segments encoding different variable regions
that are separated by over 100 kbp from a much smaller number of DNA
segments encoding the constant region of the molecule and a joining
region (Figure 1.21). This organization is maintained in most somatic
cell types, but in each individual B cell a unique DNA rearrangement event
occurs by which one specific variable region is brought together with one
joining-constant region by deletion of the intervening DNA. In this manner,
a different functional gene, containing specific variable and constant
regions is produced in each individual B cell.
It is clear that the primary role of the rearrangement of the immunoglobulin genes in B cells is the generation of the diversity of antibodies required
to cope with the vast number of different possible antigens rather than to
produce the high-level expression of the immunoglobulin genes that occurs
in such cells. Nonetheless, high-level immunoglobulin gene expression
does occur as a consequence of such rearrangements. The DNA encoding
the variable regions of the antibody molecule is closely linked to the promoter elements that direct the transcription of the gene. Such elements
show no activity in the unrearranged DNA of non-B cells, but become fully

active only when the variable region is joined to the constant region. In the
case of the immunoglobulin heavy chain genes, this is because the intervening sequence between the joining and constant regions of these genes
contains an enhancer element (see Chapter 4, Section 4.4), which –
although not a promoter itself – greatly increases the activity of the promoter adjacent to the variable region element. Rearrangement not only
brings the promoter element into a position where it can produce a functional mRNA containing variable, joining, and constant regions but also
facilitates the high-level transcription of this gene by juxtaposing promoter
and enhancer elements that are separated by over 100 kb of DNA before the
rearrangement event.
The element of gene control in this process is, however, secondary to the
need to produce diversity by rearrangement. If the immunoglobulin enhancer
is linked artificially close to the immunoglobulin promoter and introduced
into a variety of cells, it will activate transcription from the promoter only in
B cells and not in other cell types. Thus, the enhancer is active only in B cells
and would not activate immunoglobulin transcription even if functional
immunoglobulin genes containing closely linked variable, joining, and constant segments were present in all other tissues. The immunoglobulin genes
are therefore regulated by tissue-specific activator sequences in much the
same way as other genes, but such activation has been made to depend on
the occurrence of a DNA rearrangement whose primary role lies elsewhere.
It is clear from the examples of DNA changes that we have discussed,
that such cases represent special situations whose particular requirements
have necessitated the use of unusual mechanisms. In general, the DNA of
different cell types is quantitatively and qualitatively identical. Given that we
have established previously that the mRNA content of different cell types
can vary dramatically, it is now necessary to investigate how such differences in mRNA content can be produced from the similar DNA present in
such cell types.

1.4 transcrIptIonal or post-transcrIptIonal
control?
In theory, different mRNA populations could be produced from the same DNA
in different tissues or cell types by two mechanisms (Figure 1.22). First, the
control process could operate to decide which genes were transcribed to produce the primary RNA transcript within the nucleus. In such a transcriptional
control mechanism, subsequent post-transcriptional processes (such as the
removal of intervening sequences (introns) from the primary RNA transcript
and its transport to the cytoplasm: see Chapter 6), would follow automatically
(Figure 1.22a). Alternatively, it is possible that all genes would be tran-

scribed in all tissues with gene control operating at the post-transcriptional
level by deciding which primary RNA transcripts should be processed and
transported to the cytoplasm for translation into protein (Figure 1.22b).
Although there is evidence that post-transcriptional control does
operate in a number of cases (see Chapter 7), the predominant mechanism
for regulating gene expression in eukaryotes operates at the level of transcription, controlling which genes are transcribed into a primary RNA
transcript in different tissues or cell types. The evidence for this comes
from methods that directly measure gene transcription and these will now
be discussed (Methods Box 1.2).

P
The synthesis of RNA from DNA by the enzyme RNA polymerase involves
the incorporation of ribonucleotides into an RNA chain. Therefore the synthesis of any particular RNA can be measured by adding a radioactive ribonucleotide (usually uridine labeled with tritium) to the cells and measuring
how much radioactivity is incorporated into RNA specific for the gene of
interest. To minimize any degradation of the newly made RNA, the rate of
transcription is measured by exposing cells briefly to the labeled uridine in
a process referred to as pulse labeling. The labeled uridine is incorporated
into nascent RNA chains that are being made at this time and even before a
complete transcript has had time to form the cells are lysed and total RNA is
isolated from them. This RNA, which contains labeled partial transcripts
from genes active in the tissue used, is then hybridized to a piece of DNA
derived from the gene of interest, the number of radioactive counts that
bind providing a measure of the incorporation of labeled precursor into its
corresponding RNA (Figure 1.23) (see Methods Box 1.2a).
This method provides the most direct means of measuring transcription
and has been used, for example, to show that the induction of globin production that occurs in Friend erythroleukemia cells in response to treatment with
dimethyl sulfoxide is mediated by increased transcription of the globin gene.
Although pulse labeling provides a very direct measure of transcription
rates, the requirement to use very short labeling times to minimize any
effects of RNA degradation limits its applicability. In the globin case, it was
possible to measure the amount of radioactivity incorporated into globin
RNA in the very brief labeling times used (5 or 10 minutes) only because of
the enormous abundance of globin RNA and the very high rate of transcription of the globin gene. With many other RNA species, the rates of transcription are insufficient to provide measurable incorporation of label in the
short pulse time. More label will of course be incorporated if longer pulse

times are used but such pulse times allow the possibility of RNA turnover
resulting in degradation of the labeled RNA.
Although pulse labeling can be used to establish unequivocally that
transcriptional control is responsible for the massive synthesis of the highly
abundant RNA species present in terminally differentiated cells, it cannot be
used to demonstrate the generality of transcriptional control processes and
in particular their applicability to RNAs, which – although regulated in different tissues – never become highly abundant. However, another method
exists which, although less direct than pulse labeling, is more sensitive and
can be applied to a wider variety of cases including non-highly abundant
mRNAs. This method is discussed below.

N
The primary limitation on the sensitivity of pulse labeling is the existence
within the cell of a large pool of non-radioactive ribonucleotides, which are
normally used by the cell to synthesize RNA. When labeled ribonucleotide is
added to the cell, it is considerably diluted in this pool of unlabeled precursor.
The amount of label incorporated into RNA in the labeling period is therefore
very small, since the majority of ribonucleotides incorporated are unlabeled.
The sensitivity of this method is thus severely reduced, resulting in its
observed applicability only to genes with very high rates of transcription.
Interestingly however, although transcription takes place in the nucleus,
most of the pool of precursor ribonucleotides is present in the cytoplasm. It
is possible by removing the cytoplasm and isolating nuclei to remove much
of the pool of unlabeled ribonucleotide. When this occurs the RNA polymerase ceases transcribing due to lack of ribonucleotide but remains associated
with the DNA (Figure 1.24). If labeled ribonucleotides are then added
directly to the isolated nuclei in a test tube, the RNA polymerase resumes
transcribing and runs on to the end of the gene incorporating labeled ribonucleotide into the RNA transcript. Because the labeled ribonucleotides are
not diluted in the unlabeled cytoplasmic pool, considerably more label is
incorporated into any particular RNA transcript than is observed in pulse
labeling experiments. The label incorporated into any particular transcript
is detected by hybridization to its corresponding DNA exactly as in pulse
labeling experiments (see Methods Box 1.2b).
This method, which is known as a nuclear run-on assay, is therefore
much more widely applicable than pulse labeling and can be used to quantify the transcription of genes that are never transcribed at levels detectable
by pulse labeling.

Chapter 1: Levels of Gene Control

In initial studies, nuclear run-on assays were used to measure the transcription of highly abundant RNA species. For example, nuclei isolated from
the erythrocytes of adult chickens (which unlike the equivalent cells in
mammals do not lose their nuclei) were shown to transcribe the gene
encoding the adult β-globin protein. In contrast, nuclei prepared from similar cells isolated from embryonic chickens failed to transcribe this gene and
instead transcribed the gene encoding the form of β-globin made in the
embryo. Such a finding indicates that the developmentally regulated production of different forms of globin protein is under transcriptional control.
Similarly, the increase in ovalbumin mRNA levels in the chicken oviduct
following exposure to estrogen is paralleled by the ability of nuclei prepared
from estrogen-stimulated oviduct cell nuclei to transcribe the ovalbumin
gene at high levels in run-on assays. In contrast, nuclei from other tissues or
unstimulated oviduct cells failed to transcribe this gene, paralleling the
observed absence of ovalbumin RNA in the nuclei and cytoplasm of these
tissues.
The high sensitivity of nuclear run-on assays has allowed their use to
demonstrate that transcriptional control of many genes encoding specific
proteins is responsible for the previously observed differences in the levels
of these proteins in different situations. Cases where such transcriptional
control has been demonstrated in this manner are far too numerous to
mention individually but involve a range of different tissues and organisms, such as the synthesis of α-fetoprotein in fetal but not adult mammalian liver, production of insulin in the mammalian pancreas, the
expression of the D. melanogaster yolk protein genes only in ovarian follicle
cells, the expression of aggregation stage-specific genes in the slime mold
Dictyostelium discoideum and the expression of soya bean seed proteins
such as glycinin in embryonic but not adult tissues.
These studies on individual genes for particular proteins have been supplemented by more general studies which, for example, examined 12 different genes whose corresponding mRNAs were present in mouse liver
cytoplasm but were absent in brain cytoplasm. These included both genes
encoding previously isolated liver-specific proteins, such as albumin or
transferrin, and those that had been isolated simply on the basis of the
presence of their corresponding cytoplasmic RNA in the liver and not in
other tissues and for which the protein product had not yet been identified.
Measurement of the transcription rate of these genes in nuclei isolated
from brain or liver showed that such transcription was detectable only in
the liver nuclei (Figure 1.25), indicating that the difference in cytoplasmic
mRNA level was produced by a corresponding difference in gene
transcription.
In these experiments, the rate of transcription of the 12 genes was also
measured in nuclei prepared from kidney tissue. In this tissue mRNAs corresponding to two of the genes were present at a considerably lower level

than that observed in the liver, while RNA corresponding to the other 10
genes was undetectable. As with the brain nuclei, the level of transcription
detectable in the kidney nuclei exactly paralleled the level of RNA present.
Only the two genes producing cytoplasmic mRNA in the kidney were detectably transcribed in this tissue and the level of transcription of these genes
was much lower than that seen in the liver nuclei.
These studies on a number of different liver RNAs of different abundances, when taken together with the studies of many genes encoding specific proteins, indicate that for genes expressed in one or a few cell types,
increased levels of RNA and protein in a particular cell type are brought
about primarily by increases in gene transcription.

O

P
Although pulse labeling and nuclear run-on studies of many genes have
conclusively established the existence of transcriptional regulation, it is
necessary to discuss another means of demonstrating such regulation in
which increased transcription can be directly visualized. The chromosomal
DNA in the salivary glands of Drosophila is amplified many times, resulting
in giant polytene chromosomes, which contain approximately 1000 DNA
molecules (Figure 1.26). All of the DNA in the Drosophila genome is amplified in this process and there is no preferential amplification of the genes
that are expressed in the salivary gland. Thus, this example does not affect
our general conclusion that changes in the DNA do not constitute a widespread method of gene control (see Section 1.3).
However, the very large size of the polytene chromosomes allows the
visualization of events that cannot be observed in normal size chromosomes. Polytene chromosomes exhibit along their length areas known as
puffs in which the DNA has decondensed resulting in the expansion of the
chromosome (Figure 1.27). If cells are allowed to incorporate labeled ribonucleotides into RNA and the resulting RNA is then hybridized back to the
polytene chromosomes, it localizes primarily to the positions of the puffs.
Hence these puffs represent sites of intense transcriptional activity which
because of the large size of the polytene chromosomes can be directly
visualized.
Most interestingly, many conditions which in Drosophila result in the
production of new proteins, such as exposure to elevated temperature (heat
shock) or treatment with the steroid hormone ecdysone, also result in the
production of new puffs at specific sites on the polytene chromosomes, each
treatment producing a different specific pattern of puffs.

Fig

E

20

Chapter 1: Levels of Gene Control

This suggests that these sites contain the genes encoding the proteins
whose synthesis is increased by the treatment and that this increased synthesis is mediated via increased transcription of these genes which can be
visualized in the puffs. In the case of ecdysone treatment this has been
confirmed directly by showing that the radioactive RNA synthesized immediately after ecdysone treatment hybridizes strongly to the ecdysone-induced puffs but not to a puff that regresses upon hormone treatment. In
contrast, RNA prepared from cells before ecdysone treatment hybridizes
only to the hormone-repressed puff and not to the hormone-induced puffs
(Figure 1.28).
Similarly, RNA labeled after heat shock hybridizes intensely to puff 87C,
which appears following exposure to elevated temperature and is now
known to contain the gene encoding the 70 kDa heat-shock protein (HSP70),
which is the major protein made in Drosophila following heat shock (see
Chapter 4, Section 4.3 and Chapter 8, Section 8.1 for further discussion of
this gene and its induction by elevated temperature).
The large size of polytene chromosomes allows a direct visualization of
the transcriptional process and indicates that, as in other situations, gene
activity in the salivary gland is regulated at the level of transcription.

The experiments described above indicate therefore that the process of
transcription represents a key target for gene control processes. However,
such regulation of transcription could operate at two different levels. As
will be discussed in Chapter 2, the DNA is packaged with proteins to form
a structure known as chromatin. Transcriptional regulation could therefore be achieved by altering the chromatin structure so that constitutively
active regulatory molecules could gain access and switch on transcription
(Figure 1.29a).
Alternatively, the chromatin structure could be accessible at all times
with the activation of transcriptional regulatory proteins inducing transcription to produce the primary RNA transcript (Figure 1.29b). In fact it appears
that both these mechanisms are frequently used together in particular cases
and a move to a more open chromatin structure is followed by the activation of a transcriptional regulatory protein (Figure 1.29c).
Many studies on the role in gene regulation of chromatin structure and
transcriptional regulatory proteins have examined individual genes whose
expression is regulated in a particular manner. Increasingly however, such
studies have involved examining these parameters across the entire
genome. For example, the ENCODE (Encyclopedia of DNA elements) project
aims to examine changes in chromatin structure and transcriptional

regulatory protein binding to DNA across the entire human genome and to
relate these features both to each other and to the population of RNA molecules produced by gene transcription (Figure 1.30).
Because of the critical importance of all these processes in gene regulation, the structure of chromatin will be discussed in Chapter 2 and its role in
the regulation of gene transcription will be considered in Chapter 3.
Similarly, the actual process of gene transcription by RNA polymerases will
be discussed in Chapter 4 and its regulation will be considered in Chapter 5.
In addition, because a number of examples of post-transcriptional control
do exist, post-transcriptional events will be discussed in Chapter 6 and their
regulation will be considered in Chapter 7.

RNA
So far in this chapter we have considered gene control in terms of the central dogma of molecular biology, namely that DNA produces RNA which in
turn produces proteins. Of course, it has been known for some time that
some cellular RNAs have a direct functional role rather than being translated into protein. These include the URNAs, which are involved in the process by which the primary transcript is processed to produce the mature
mRNA (see Chapter 6, Section 6.3), and the ribosomal and transfer RNAs,
which play a key role in the translation of the mRNA into protein (see
Chapter 6, Section 6.6).
Recently however, it has become clear that both long RNA molecules of
over 200 bases in length and small RNAs between 20 and 30 bases in length
play a key role in inhibiting the expression of protein-coding genes by interacting with specific genes and mRNAs.
Although a number of these regulatory RNA molecules were initially
identified by studying the regulation of individual genes, the existence and
widespread use of regulatory RNAs are entirely consistent with one of the
major conclusions of the ENCODE project discussed at the end of the previous section of this chapter (Section 1.4). Thus, in this study, transcription of
the human genome was found to be far more extensive than expected.
Around three-quarters of the human genome appears to be transcribed into
RNA and such transcription is highly regulated under different conditions. In
contrast, the actual protein-coding DNA makes up only around 1% of the
genome and protein-coding genes are interdigitated with regions that are
transcribed into RNA but do not code for protein.
Interestingly, functional studies have indicated that regulatory RNAs regulate gene expression at both transcriptional and post-transcriptional levels. They will therefore be introduced in this section and their roles in regulating transcription and in post-transcriptional gene regulation at different
levels such as mRNA turnover or mRNA translation will be discussed in
subsequent chapters, (see especially Chapter 3, Section 3.4 and Chapter 7,
Section 7.7) (Figure 1.31).
In this section, we will first discuss the three major classes of small RNA,
namely the microRNAs (miRNAs), the small interfering RNAs (siRNAs),
and the Piwi-interacting RNAs (piRNAs), which differ in their mechanism
of production and in their biological roles (see Table 1.1 for a summary of
these differences). Subsequently, we will discuss the longer regulatory RNAs,
which are defined as those RNAs that are over 200 bases in length.

M
The first miRNA to be discovered was identified by genetic experiments in
the nematode worm. It was shown that inactivation of the lin-4 gene by
mutation had the same effect as a gain of function mutation in the lin-14
gene, indicating that the two genes were likely to be antagonistic to one

another. Moreover, it was subsequently shown that the lin-4 gene produces
a 22 nucleotide miRNA which can base pair with the lin-14 gene mRNA.
This led to the suggestion that base pairing of the lin-4 miRNA to the lin-14
gene mRNA inhibits lin-14 gene expression (Figure 1.32). This idea was
subsequently shown to be correct since, as discussed in Chapter 7 (Section
7.7), binding of the lin-4 miRNA to the lin-14 mRNA blocks the translation of
the mRNA into the corresponding protein.
Interestingly, this interaction plays a key role in nematode development,
with lin-4 being expressed at the second larval stage in development when
it blocks lin-14 expression. In contrast, lin-4 is not expressed at the first larval stage, so allowing lin-14 mRNA to be translated at the appropriate point
in embryonic development.
Following this initial discovery of an miRNA in 1993, there has been an
explosion of information on miRNAs. A large number of miRNAs have been

discovered in a range of organisms from humans and flies to plants and
worms and shown to play a key role in specific biological events. For example, humans have been shown to express over 1000 different miRNAs.
Moreover, binding of an miRNA to an mRNA can occur on the basis of
only partial complementarity between their sequences, with only some
bases in the miRNA forming base pairs with the mRNA. This allows an individual miRNA to bind to multiple mRNAs that have different target
sequences capable of partially base pairing with the miRNA. In turn, this
allows one individual miRNA to inhibit the expression of many different
target genes (Figure 1.33). As will be discussed in Chapter 7 (Section 7.7),
in different cases, miRNAs can inhibit gene expression post-transcriptionally either by blocking translation of the target mRNA or by promoting its
degradation.
By these means, miRNAs play a key role in regulating gene expression in a
wide range of cell types in many different organisms and a number of examples will be discussed in subsequent chapters. A particularly dramatic example
is provided by the mouse miRNA, miR-181. This miRNA is expressed specifically in B lymphocytes but not in their progenitor cells. However, its artificial
overexpression in the progenitor cells is sufficient to induce their differentiation to mature B lymphocytes (Figure 1.34), suggesting that this microRNA is
likely to play a key role in the normal differentiation of these cells.
The key role of miRNAs in regulating gene expression in a range of
organisms focuses attention on the manner in which they are synthesized.
Interestingly, in animals microRNAs are transcribed as larger precursor
RNAs, known as pri-miRNAs, with transcription being carried out by RNA
polymerase II, the same polymerase which transcribes the genes encoding
mRNAs (see Chapter 4, Section 4.1). As with mRNA precursors, the primiRNA is modified at its 5′ end by capping and at its 3′ end by polyadenylation (see Chapter 6, Sections 6.1 and 6.2 for an account of these
post-transcriptional processes).

All these events take place in the nucleus of the cell and are followed by
the transport of the pre-miRNA to the cytoplasm. Here it is cleaved again by
the Dicer protein (Figure 1.35c). This removes the single-stranded loop of
the pre-miRNA, leaving two single-stranded RNA molecules base paired to
one another (Figure 1.35d). One of these single strands is then degraded,
leaving the other which represents the mature miRNA free to bind to its
target mRNAs (Figure 1.35e).

M
In contrast to miRNAs, many small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) are processed from a double-stranded RNA rather than from a single-stranded
RNA that has formed a hairpin loop. The production of siRNA was initially
characterized as a defense mechanism against invading viruses, which
often produce double-stranded RNAs as part of their life cycle. In response
to this, the same Dicer protein as is involved in miRNA processing binds
to the double-stranded RNA. Dicer then cuts the double-stranded RNA
into smaller double-stranded RNA molecules. Following separation of the
two strands of these smaller RNAs, one of the strands forms the siRNA. It
can then bind to viral mRNA which is identical in sequence to the original
double-stranded RNA and promote its degradation, thereby inhibiting
viral gene expression post-transcriptionally (Figure 1.36).
As well as functioning as a cellular defense mechanism against viral
infection, the existence of siRNAs also explains a phenomenon observed in
some transgenic experiments involving the introduction of specific genes
into animals or plants. In some such experiments, it was noted that not only
was the introduced transgene not expressed but the endogenous copy of the
same gene was also specifically silenced.
This effect occurs when the transgene inserts into the genome close to a
cellular promoter which transcribes the transgene in an antisense orientation. This antisense RNA transcript can bind to the normal sense RNA
transcript of the transgene and produce a double-stranded RNA. In turn, this
double-stranded RNA will bind Dicer, which will cut it up to produce siRNAs. Such siRNAs can bind both to the mRNA of the transgene and to mRNA
derived from the corresponding endogenous gene, inhibiting their expression (Figure 1.37).

 Regulatory RNAs and the regulation of gene expression
As well as silencing the expression of invading viruses and artificially
introduced transgenes, siRNA is also involved in regulating endogenous
cellular genes in normal rather than artificial situations and this has recently
been demonstrated in mammalian cells. This can involve the transcription
of a pseudogene which is homologous to the functional gene but cannot
encode a protein due, for example, to it containing stop codons which
would terminate translation prematurely (see Chapter 6, Section 6.6). In
these cases, the pseudogene is transcribed to produce an antisense transcript which can hybridize to the protein-encoding sense transcript of the
functional gene. This double-stranded RNA is evidently a substrate for the
production of siRNA, which can then bind to further copies of the functional
RNA and inhibit its expression (Figure 1.38).
Such an antisense pseudogene transcript is evidently a long regulatory
RNA (defined as an RNA molecule over 200 bases in length that regulates
gene expression). As will be discussed below, long regulatory RNAs act via
a variety of mechanisms. In this case however, the antisense RNA acts by
inducing the production of siRNAs which then act to inhibit gene expression. This indicates that long and short regulatory RNAs can act together to
inhibit gene expression.
Indeed, it appears that expression of the mammalian gene encoding
histone deacetylase 1 (Hdac1) is regulated in this manner, with an
Hdac1 pseudogene being transcribed in the opposite direction to the functional Hdac1 gene. This is of particular interest since, as will be discussed in
Chapter 2 (Section 2.3) and Chapter 3 (Section 3.3) acetylation/deacetylation of histones plays a key role in the regulation of chromatin structure and
therefore in transcriptional regulation. This example therefore illustrates
the manner in which the siRNA system can potentially regulate the expression of a gene encoding a protein which itself has a gene regulatory role.
Interestingly, siRNAs not only act post-transcriptionally as in this example but can also act at the transcriptional level by binding to a target gene
and inducing an inactive chromatin structure (see Chapter 3, Section 3.4).
It is clear therefore that both miRNAs and siRNAs play key roles in the
regulation of gene expression. Indeed, mice lacking the gene for Dicer die
early in embryonic development, indicating the key role of these pathways,
both of which involve the Dicer protein in producing the functional mature
small RNA.

Functional gene

Piwi-interacting RNAs (piRNAs) are 21–31 bases in length and were originally identified in the germ cells (sperm and eggs) of the fruit fly Drosophila.
They were subsequently shown to be expressed in these cell types in a wide
range of animals from mammals to nematode worms.
Like the miRNAs and siRNAs, piRNAs are processed from a larger precursor RNA but the processing pathway differs fundamentally from that of
miRNAs or siRNAs. Thus, the primary transcript is shortened at both its 5′
and 3′ ends (Figure 1.39a) in a manner that unlike the siRNAs or the
miRNAs does not involve the Dicer protein. Similarly, unlike miRNAs and
siRNAs, the shortened piRNA then associates with Piwi proteins (hence
giving these RNAs their name of Piwi-interacting RNAs) (Figure 1.39b)
and then undergoes further shortening at its 3′ end to form the active complex of Piwi protein-associated with the mature piRNA (Figure 1.39c).
As noted above, piRNAs have been best characterized in the germ cells
of different organisms, where they appear to function to maintain the integrity of the genome so that it is transmitted intact to the next generation.
Thus, piRNAs function to inhibit the activity of DNA transposable elements
(transposons) that would otherwise move around the genome and potentially damage it. Such transposable elements frequently move around the
genome by producing an RNA transcript of their DNA. This RNA transcript
is then copied into a DNA molecule that inserts elsewhere into the genome.
The piRNAs function by binding to the transposon RNA transcript and inducing its degradation, so preventing transposition (Figure 1.40).
As well as this initial phase of post-transcriptional silencing, the binding
of piRNAs to their target also induces the production of a further type of
small RNAs, known as 22G-RNAs, which as their name suggests are 22
nucleotides in length. These 22G-RNAs are produced by copying the target
transposon RNA and are therefore complementary to it. The 22G-RNAs produced in this way associate with WAGO proteins and via their sequence
complementarity bind to further copies of the transposon transcript and
induce its degradation. However, they also bind to the transposon DNA

itself and block its transcription by altering the methylation pattern of the
transposon DNA, resulting in a tightly packed chromatin structure incompatible with transcription (Figure 1.41) (see Chapter 3, Section 3.2).
This mechanism therefore enhances the efficiency of transposon inhibition by producing further small RNAs which target the transposon at
both the DNA and RNA levels. Moreover, since altered DNA methylation
patterns can be inherited by daughter cells produced by cell division,
this inhibition of transposon activity can be passed on to subsequent
generations.
Although the inhibition of transposon activity is a key part of the natural
function of piRNAs, it is part of a broader role in protecting genome integrity. Thus, transgenes artificially inserted into the germ line are also subject
to inhibition by piRNAs, paralleling the role of siRNAs in inhibiting transgene expression that was discussed above.

Chapter 1: Levels of Gene Control

As well as their role in germ cells, piRNAs have also been shown to be
expressed in other cell types and to have a role in the regulation of cellular
gene expression (Figure 1.42). Thus, as will be discussed in Chapter 3
(Section 3.4), piRNAs can recruit the HP1 factor to cellular DNA. This in
turn promotes the organization of a tightly packed chromatin structure,
paralleling the effect of piRNAs on the chromatin structure of transposons.
In addition, as discussed in Chapter 7 (Section 7.7) a piRNA binds to the
nanos mRNA at the anterior end of the early embryo in Drosophila. This
induces the degradation of the nanos mRNA, thereby contributing to the
posterior-anterior gradient in nanos expression levels that is critical for the
correct development of the Drosophila embryo.
Hence, like siRNAs, piRNAs can inhibit gene expression at both transcriptional and post-transcriptional levels. Moreover, like siRNAs, piRNAs
appear to function both in protecting the cell from damage by foreign DNA
elements such as transposons and viruses and in the regulation of cellular
gene expression (Figure 1.42).

It is clear from the discussion above that the various classes of small RNA
molecules play a key role in a variety of processes, including the regulation
of cellular gene expression. In our discussion so far, however, we have considered only situations where these small RNAs are synthesized and processed in a particular cell and produce a biological effect in that cell.
Recently however, it has become clear that small RNAs or their precursors can move from the cell where they are synthesized and exert a biological effect in other cells. This has been demonstrated in the case of the
miRNAs which can be released from cells either within microvesicles that
bud out of the cell or as free miRNA molecules associated with RNA-binding
proteins. They can then be taken up by other cells and exert a biological
effect in those cells (Figure 1.43).
Interestingly, such movement from cell to cell has also been demonstrated for the siRNAs by experiments in plants that involve grafting together
a shoot from a normal plant with a root from a plant that has been genetically manipulated so that it cannot synthesize siRNAs. In these experiments,
siRNAs appear in the root tissue where they can exert a biological effect.
This demonstrates that in plants at least, siRNAs can not only move from
cell to cell but can be transported over long distances from one part of the
plant to another (Figure 1.44).
Clearly therefore, the ability of both miRNAs and siRNAs to move from
cell to cell will greatly enhance their effects on cellular gene expression and
other biological processes, since it allows them to function not only in the
cell where they are synthesized but also in other target cells.

As well as the short RNAs discussed above, a wide variety of noncoding
RNAs of greater than 200 bases in length have been characterized and

shown to play a key role in the regulation of cellular gene expression. These
are known as long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs).
One class of such lncRNAs are transcribed from the promoter or
enhancer DNA regions (see Chapter 4, Sections 4.3 and 4.4), which control
the production of protein-coding RNAs. Such promoter and enhancer elements normally act at the DNA level by binding regulatory proteins that
control the transcription of the protein-coding gene. These elements are
not themselves transcribed as part of the protein-coding transcript.
However, in some cases such regions can be separately transcribed to
produce a regulatory RNA. This could involve, for example, the regulatory
RNA being transcribed from the same promoter as the protein-coding
transcript but in the opposite orientation (Figure 1.45a). Such a promoter
which is transcribed in both directions is referred to as a bidirectional promoter (see Chapter 4, Section 4.3 for discussion of gene promoters).
In different cases, regulatory RNAs produced in this way can regulate
transcription at both the stages discussed in Section 1.4, namely at the level
of chromatin structure and at the level of actual production of the primary
RNA transcript. Thus, in some cases, the regulatory RNA can recruit protein
factors which produce a tightly packed chromatin structure incompatible
with transcription (Figure 1.46a) (see Chapters 2 and 3 for further

discussion of chromatin structure and its regulation). In other cases the regulatory RNA can bind a transcriptional regulatory protein which normally
binds to the promoter or enhancer DNA and stimulates gene transcription
(see Chapters 4 and 5 for a discussion of proteins that regulate transcription). Clearly, such binding of the transcriptional regulatory protein by the
RNA will prevent it binding to the promoter or enhancer and thereby block
gene transcription (Figure 1.46b).
The cases described above would result in transcription of the lncRNA
repressing transcription by producing an inhibitory chromatin structure or
by competing for activating proteins. It is also possible however, for the
lncRNA to activate transcription by recruiting factors that open the chromatin structure or bind to DNA and activate transcription. This is of particular
importance in a number of enhancers where the production of the lncRNA
correlates with situations where the enhancer is active. This is discussed
further in Chapter 4 (Section 4.4).
As well as the regulatory RNAs which are transcribed from promoter or
enhancer regions, other regulatory RNAs are transcribed from the same
region as the protein-coding transcript (Figure 1.45b). Such transcription
frequently occurs from the opposite strand of the DNA to that producing the
protein-coding RNA, resulting in a so-called antisense transcript. Such a
transcript could clearly function to recruit protein factors regulating chromatin structure in the same way as occurs for regulatory RNAs derived from
promoter or enhancer regions (Figure 1.47a).

 Regulatory RNAs and the regulation of gene expression
However, antisense transcripts can also bind directly to the proteincoding RNA transcript as they are complementary to it. This will result in
the production of a double-stranded RNA which, as noted in our earlier
discussion of siRNAs, is a substrate for the production of siRNAs that can
then bind to further copies of the functional RNA and inhibit its production
at the post-transcriptional level (Figure 1.47b). Hence, long regulatory
RNAs of this type can regulate transcription at both the transcriptional and
post-transcriptional levels.
As discussed earlier in this chapter in the section on siRNAs, a doublestranded RNA substrate for siRNA production can also occur when an antisense long regulatory RNA transcript is produced by a pseudogene that is
homologous to a functional gene but cannot encode a functional protein
(see Figure 1.38). This therefore represents an example of an lncRNA that is
derived from a completely different region of the genome to the gene it targets (Figure 1.45c). Indeed, many long regulatory RNAs are of this type
rather than being derived from the target gene itself (Figure 1.45b) or its
regulatory regions (Figure 1.45a).
Interestingly, as well as being involved in siRNA generation
(Figure 1.48a), long regulatory RNAs can also interact with miRNAs

(Figure 1.48b). Thus, a pseudogene is defined as being similar to a functional gene but being unable to encode a functional protein due, for example, to the presence of translational stop codons (see the discussion of
siRNAs above). Hence, a transcript of a pseudogene produced in the same
orientation equivalent to the protein-coding transcript (rather than antisense to it) will not function as a protein-coding mRNA. However, since it
is similar in sequence to the protein-coding transcript it will, for example,
be able to bind miRNAs that would otherwise bind to the protein-coding
RNA and inhibit it post-transcriptionally. Hence, in this case, the regulatory RNA can bind inhibitory miRNAs and hence enhance expression of
the protein-coding gene at a post-transcriptional level.
It is clear therefore that long regulatory RNAs, whether transcribed from
a gene regulatory region, from the gene itself, or from another region of the
genome, can play a key role in the regulation of gene expression and can
have positive or negative effects on gene expression. In different cases, this
can occur at the transcriptional or post-transcriptional levels and can
involve proteins that regulate chromatin structure or transcription itself as
well as both siRNAs and miRNAs. Examples of the involvement of lncRNAs
in specific biological processes will be discussed in subsequent chapters
(see for example, Chapter 3, Section 3.6).

CONCLUS
The central dogma of molecular biology is that DNA makes RNA and RNA
makes protein. In this chapter we have seen that the DNA content of different tissues and cell types is generally the same. However, the RNA and
protein content of different tissues and cell types are both qualitatively and
quantitatively different.
This indicates that gene control must operate to produce different mRNA
and thus different protein populations in different tissues and cell types from
the same genomic DNA. A variety of evidence indicates that the major
gene control point is at the level of transcription. Regulatory processes
therefore control which genes are transcribed into the primary RNA transcript with processing of this transcript to produce the mRNA following
subsequently.
In turn, such transcriptional regulation appears to operate both at the
level of chromatin structure in opening up the gene to allow access to proteins involved in transcription and also at the level of the actual process of
gene transcription by RNA polymerase II. Accordingly, the structure of
chromatin and its role in gene control are discussed in Chapters 2 and 3,
respectively. Similarly, the process of transcription itself and its regulation
are discussed in Chapters 4 and 5, respectively.
Although transcriptional control is the major form of gene control in
eukaryotes, post-transcriptional gene regulation also occurs, often as a
significant supplement to transcriptional control. Chapter 6 therefore
discusses the processes that modify the primary transcript to produce
the mRNA as well as the translation of the mRNA into protein, while
Chapter 7 discusses the role of these processes in gene regulation.
Interestingly, the recent explosion in information on both small and
large regulatory RNAs (see Section 1.5) indicates that they can inhibit
gene expression both by regulating chromatin structure and by regulating post-transcriptional processes such as RNA turnover and translation
into protein. These effects are discussed in Chapters 3 (Section 3.4) and
7 (Section 7.6), respectively.
Evidently, the fundamental processes involved in gene regulation, which
are discussed in Chapters 2 to 7, play a vital role in embryonic development
and the functioning of the adult organism. The role of gene regulation in the
cellular response to external signals, in embryonic development itself and
in the differentiation and functioning of specific cell types is therefore discussed in Chapters 8 to 10.

Finally, in view of the complexity of gene regulatory processes and their
vital role, it is not surprising that they can go wrong and that this has damaging effects on the organism. Chapters 11 and 12 therefore discuss the role
of gene control processes in cancer and other human diseases, respectively,
as well as the manner in which the manipulation of gene regulatory processes may ultimately be of therapeutic benefit.

Key concepts
•

The central dogma of molecular biology is that DNA produces RNA
which in turn produces proteins.

•

Different tissues and cell types of the same organism show
differences in the different proteins that are present and in their
relative abundance.

•

Similarly, different tissues and cell types show differences in the
RNAs that are present and in their relative abundance.

•

Unlike the RNA and protein content, the DNA of different tissues
and cell types is generally the same in a specific organism.

•

Gene control must therefore operate to produce different RNA
populations in different cell types from the same DNA.

•

The major point of gene control is at the level of transcription
regulating which genes are transcribed to produce a primary RNA
transcript in different cell types.

•

Small and large regulatory RNAs play a key role in gene
regulation, acting to regulate both transcriptional and
post-transcriptional processes.

Structure of Chromatin

INTRODUCTION
In the previous chapter, we discussed the evidence indicating that the primary control of eukaryotic gene expression lies at the level of transcription,
with regulatory processes determining which genes are transcribed to produce the primary RNA transcript. To understand gene control processes it is
therefore necessary to investigate the mechanisms responsible for such
transcriptional control.

Regulation of transcription in eukaryotes is much more complex
than in prokaryotes
The fact that regulation at transcription is also responsible for the control of
gene expression in bacteria suggests that insights into these procedures
obtained in these much simpler organisms may be applicable to higher
organisms. In bacteria, transcription of many genes such as those in the lac
operon is controlled by negative regulatory mechanisms in which the presence of repressor molecules inhibits gene transcription. Inactivation of such
repressors in response to a specific signal therefore leads to transcription of
the gene.
It is possible therefore that regulation of transcription in eukaryotes
might similarly occur by means of a protein which is present in all tissues
and binds to the promoter region of a particular gene preventing its expression. In one particular cell type or in response to a particular signal such as
elevated temperature, this protein would be inactivated either directly
(Figure 2.1a) or by binding of another factor (Figure 2.1b), and would no
longer bind to the gene. Indeed, such transcriptional control mediated by
transcriptional repressors does operate in eukaryotes (see in particular
Chapter 5, Section 5.3).
However, many eukaryotic genes are inactive in most tissues and
become active only in one tissue or in response to a particular signal. In
many cases therefore it is more economical to have a system in which the
gene is constitutively inactive in most tissues without any repressor being
required. Activation of the gene would then require a particular activating
factor binding to its promoter. Positive regulatory mechanisms of this type
are used to control the expression of some genes in bacteria in response to
specific signals.
Such activation mechanisms would involve the specific expression pattern of the gene being controlled by the presence of a positively acting factor only in the expressing cell type (Figure 2.2a) or alternatively by the
factor’s requirement for a co–factor such as a steroid hormone to convert it
to an active form (Figure 2.2b).
Based on the known mechanisms of gene regulation in bacteria, it is
possible therefore to produce models of how gene regulation might operate

in eukaryotes. Indeed, a considerable amount of evidence indicates that
many cases of gene regulation do use activation-type mechanisms of the
type illustrated in Figure 2.2 in which the gene is not transcribed except in
the presence of an activating factor. For example, as will be discussed in
Chapter 5 (Section 5.1) and Chapter 8 (Section 8.1), the effects of glucocorticoid and other steroid hormones on gene expression are mediated by the
binding of the steroid to a receptor protein. This activated complex then
binds to particular sequences upstream of steroid–responsive genes and
activates their transcription.
Even in the case of steroid hormones however, such mechanisms cannot account entirely for the regulation of gene expression. In the chicken,
administration of the steroid hormone estrogen results in the transcriptional activation in oviduct tissue of the gene encoding ovalbumin, as discussed in Chapter 1 (Section 1.4). In the liver of the same organism however, estrogen treatment has no effect on the ovalbumin gene but instead
results in the activation of a completely different gene encoding the protein
vitellogenin. Such tissue–specific differences in the response to a particular
treatment are of course, entirely absent in single–celled bacteria and cannot
be explained simply on the basis of the activation of a single DNA–binding
protein by the hormone (Figure 2.3).
An understanding of eukaryotic gene regulation will therefore require
a knowledge of the ways in which relatively short-term regulatory processes mediated by the binding of proteins to specific DNA sequences
interact with much longer-term regulatory processes, which establish and
maintain the differences between particular tissues and also control their
response to treatment with effectors such as steroids. These differences
involve packaging DNA with proteins to form the structure known as
chromatin.
Hence, eukaryotic gene regulation requires both long-term processes
which regulate chromatin structure and more short-term processes which
actually result in the activation of gene transcription. Only the second type
of process is found in bacteria where regulation of chromatin structure
does not occur. The basic structure of chromatin and the manner in which
it is formed will therefore be discussed in this chapter, while the long-term
control processes which regulate chromatin structure and thereby regulate
gene expression will be discussed in Chapter 3. The process of transcription itself and its control by regulatory factors is discussed in Chapters 4
and 5, respectively.

COMMITMeNT TO THe DIFFeReNTIATeD
STATe AND ITS STABILITY

Cells can remain committed to a particular differentiated state
even in the absence of its phenotypic characteristics
It is evident that the existence of different tissues and cell types in higher
eukaryotes requires mechanisms that establish and maintain such differences, and that these mechanisms must be stable in the long term. In general, tissues or cells of one type do not change spontaneously into another
cell type and cells must be capable therefore of maintaining their differentiated phenotype throughout their lifetimes.
Indeed, the long-term control processes which regulate chromatin
structure in order to achieve this effect must regulate not only the ability to
maintain the differentiated state more or less indefinitely but also the
observed ability of cells to remember their particular cell type, even under
conditions when they cannot express the characteristic phenotype of that
cell type. For example, it is possible to regulate the behavior of cartilage–
producing cells in culture by changing the medium in which they are
placed. In one medium the cells are capable of expressing their differentiated phenotype and produce cartilage–forming colonies synthesizing an
extracellular matrix containing chondroitin sulfate. By contrast, in a different medium favoring rapid division, the cells do not form such colonies and

instead divide rapidly and lose all the specific characteristics of cartilage
cells, becoming indistinguishable from undifferentiated fibroblast–like cells
in appearance.
Nonetheless, even after 20 generations in this rapid growth medium, the
cells can resume the appearance of cartilage cells and synthesis of chondroitin sulfate if returned to the appropriate medium. This process does not
occur if other cell types or undifferentiated fibroblast cells are placed in an
identical medium. The cartilage cells are therefore capable not only of
maintaining their differentiated phenotype in a particular medium supplying
appropriate signals, but also of remembering that phenotype in the absence
of such signals and returning to the correct differentiated state when placed
in the appropriate medium (Figure 2.4).

Cells can become committed to a particular differentiated state
before actual phenotypic differentiation
The experiments described above suggest that cells belong to a particular
lineage and that mechanisms exist to maintain the commitment of cells to
a particular lineage, even in the absence of the characteristics of the differentiated phenotype. Considerable evidence exists to suggest that cells
become committed to a particular differentiated stage or lineage well before
they express any features characteristic of that lineage and that such commitment can be maintained through many cell generations.
Perhaps the most dramatic example of this effect occurs in the fruit fly,
Drosophila melanogaster. In this organism, the larva contains many discs
consisting of undifferentiated cells located at intervals along the length of
the body and indistinguishable from each other in appearance. Eventually,
these imaginal discs will form the structures of the adult, the most anterior pair producing the antennae and others producing the wings, legs, etc..
To do this however, the discs must pass through the intermediate pupal
state where they receive the appropriate signals to differentiate into the
adult structures. If they are removed from the larva and placed directly in

Chapter 2: Structure of Chromatin

the body cavity of the adult they will remain in an undifferentiated state
since the signals inducing differentiation will not have been received
(Figure 2.5).
This process can be continued for many generations. The disc removed
from the adult can be split in two, one half being used to propagate the
cells by being placed directly in another adult and the other half being
tested to see what it will produce when placed in a larva that is allowed to
proceed to an adult through the pupal state. In this experiment, a disc that
would have given rise to an antenna can still do so when placed in a larva
after many generations of passage through adult organisms in an undifferentiated state. This is the case even if the disc is placed at a position within
the larva very different from that normally occupied by the imaginal disc
producing the antenna. The cells of the imaginal disc within the normal
larva must therefore have undergone a commitment event to the eventual
production of a particular differentiated state, which they can maintain for
many generations, before having ever expressed any phenotypic features
characteristic of that differentiated state (Figure 2.5).
These examples of the stability of the differentiated state and commitment to it imply the existence of long-term regulatory processes capable
of maintaining such stability. However, there are cases where such stability breaks down, for example, following nuclear transplantation (see
Chapter 1, Section 1.3), indicating that such processes, although stable,
are not irreversible.
Indeed, even in the imaginal discs of Drosophila the stability of the committed state can be lost by culture for long periods in adults with the discs
giving rise when eventually placed in the larva to tissues other than the one
intended originally. This breakdown of the committed state is not a random
process but proceeds in a highly reproducible manner. Wing cells are the
first abnormal cells produced by a disc that should produce an eye, with
other cell types being produced only subsequently. Similarly, a disc that
should produce a leg never produces genitalia, although it can produce
other cell types. The various transitions that can occur in this system are

summarized in Figure 2.6. Interestingly, these various transitions are precisely those observed in the homeotic mutations in Drosophila (see
Chapter 5, Section 5.1 and Chapter 9, Section 9.2) which convert one adult
body part into another. Each of these transitions is likely therefore to be
controlled by a specific gene whose activity changes when commitment
breaks down.
These examples and the other experiments discussed in Chapter 1
(Section 1.3) eliminate irreversible mechanisms such as DNA loss as a
means of explaining the process of commitment to the differentiated state.
Rather, the semi-stability of this process and its propagation through many
cell generations is due to the establishment of a particular pattern of association of the DNA with specific proteins. The structure formed by DNA and
its associated proteins is known as chromatin. An understanding of how
long-term gene regulation is achieved therefore requires a knowledge of
the structure of chromatin.

2.2 ​THe NUCLeOSOMe
The nucleosome is the basic unit of chromatin structure
If the DNA in a single human individual were to exist as an extended linear molecule, it would have a length of 5 × 1010 kilometers and would
extend 100 times the distance from the Earth to the Sun. Even the DNA in
a single cell would extend for 2 meters if it was not compacted in some
way. Clearly therefore, the DNA must be compacted to fit in the nucleus
of the cell. This is achieved by folding the DNA in a complex with specific
nuclear proteins into the structure known as chromatin. Of central importance in this process are the five types of histone proteins (Table 2.1)
whose high proportion of the positively charged amino acids lysine and
arginine neutralizes the net negative charge on the DNA and allows folding to occur.
The basic unit of this folded structure is the nucleosome, in which
approximately 200 base pairs of DNA are associated with a histone
octamer containing two molecules of each of the four core histones,
H2A, H2B, H3, and H4 (Figure 2.7). In this structure approximately 146
base pairs of DNA make almost two full turns around the histone octamer,
and the remainder serves as linker DNA joining one nucleosome to
another. As expected from the key role of the histones in nucleosome
structure, these proteins are highly conserved in evolution. For example,
the histone H4 of a cow differs by only two amino acids from that of a
garden pea, while the histone H3 molecules exhibit only four amino acid
differences in these two species.
Each of the four core histones has a similar structure with an aminoterminal tail and a helical region which forms three α-helices separated by

known as the histone fold (Figure 2.9a), which in turn allows individual
histones to associate with one another (Figure 2.9b).
The detailed arrangement of the histones and the DNA within the nucleosome has been confirmed by high-resolution structural analysis using
X-ray crystallography. In the nucleosomal structure, the histones form
H2A-H2B and H3-H4 heterodimers via the histone fold. These heterodimers then associate to form the histone octamer with the DNA wrapped
around the surface of the octamer (Figure 2.10). Interestingly, the
amino-terminal tails of the histones extend beyond the surface of the
nucleosome particle and are likely to be involved in interactions between
nucleosomes. This is of particular interest since these amino-terminal histone tails are subject to specific modifications which are known to alter
chromatin structure (see Section 2.3). These modifications are likely to act
by affecting the nucleosome–nucleosome interactions which are mediated
via these regions of the histone molecule.

In this structure, the linker DNA is more accessible than the highly
protected DNA tightly wrapped around the octamer and is therefore preferentially cleaved when chromatin is digested with small amounts of the
DNA–digesting enzyme, micrococcal nuclease. If DNA is isolated
following such mild digestion of chromatin, it produces a ladder of
­
DNA fragments in multiples of 200 base pairs on gel electrophoresis
representing the results of cleavage in some but not all linker regions
(Figure 2.11a, track T).
This can be correlated with the properties of nucleosomes isolated from
the digested chromatin. A partially digested chromatin preparation can be
fractionated into individual nucleosomes associated with 200 bases of DNA
(Figure 2.11a, track D), dinucleosomes associated with 400 bases of DNA
(Figure 2.11a, track C), and so on. The individual mononucleosomes, dinucleosomes, or larger complexes in each of these fractions can be observed
readily in the electron microscope (Figure 2.11b). These experiments
therefore provide direct evidence for the organization of DNA into nucleosomes within the cell. Indeed, further digestion with micrococcal nuclease
resulting in cleavage within all inter-nucleosome linker regions can reduce
the chromatin preparation to mononucleosomes each associated with 200
base pairs of DNA.
This organization of DNA into nucleosomes can be directly visualized in
the electron microscope when chromatin is isolated under conditions of low
ionic strength. This yields a fiber that has a diameter of 10 nm and appears
as beads on a string in the electron microscope, with nucleosomes joined
by visible linker DNA (Figure 2.12). This beads-on-a-string structure constitutes the first stage in the packaging of DNA.

Nucleosome structure or position can be altered by chromatin
remodeling processes
The nucleosome is a highly dynamic structure. The DNA is continuously
unwrapping from the histone octamer, remaining exposed for a short period
and then rewrapping around the histones (Figure 2.13).
This dynamic nature of the nucleosome is of considerable importance
in the process of chromatin remodeling in which specific protein
complexes hydrolyze ATP and use the energy to displace the nucleosome
or modify its structure. Several multiprotein chromatin remodeling
complexes exist in eukaryotic cells and these are classified into several
families, the best characterized of which are the SWI/SNF family and the
ISWI family.
Each chromatin remodeling complex contains an ATPase component
which actually hydrolyzes ATP to generate the energy for the remodeling
process. The structure of the ISW1a chromatin remodeling factor complexed with a dinucleosome is illustrated in Figure 2.14, indicating that

change in the structure of the nucleosome so that the DNA is more
exposed (Figure 2.15a). Second, it can involve the displacement of the
nucleosome so that it moves along the DNA (Figure 2.15b). Finally, it
can involve the complete displacement of the nucleosome so that it is
lost from the DNA molecule (Figure 2.15c). These changes make specific regions of DNA more accessible to specific regulatory molecules and
their key role in gene control will be discussed further in Chapter 3
(Section 3.5).
Our understanding of the positioning of nucleosomes and the manner
in which it can be altered has been greatly aided by the availability of methods that can analyze such positioning across an entire genome under different conditions.
One such method relies on the finding described above that micrococcal nuclease can digest the chromatin to produce mononucleosomes. In
this method (Methods Box 2.1), nucleosomes within the chromatin are
cross-linked to the DNA within intact cells (Figure 2.16a). The chromatin is then isolated (Figure 2.16b) and subjected to digestion with micrococcal nuclease (Figure 2.16c). The nucleosomes are then purified by
using an antibody to one of the histones (Figure 2.16c). The DNA is then
isolated and the 200 base pair fragments that were associated with mononucleosomes are isolated by gel purification (Figure 2.16d) (see Figure
2.11a for an example of such gel analysis of nucleosomal DNA). These
fragments can then be analyzed by high-throughput DNA sequencing,
allowing the sequences associated with nucleosomes to be identified by
comparison to the available whole genome sequence of the appropriate
organism (Figure 2.16e).
If the entire genome of a particular organism has been sequenced, it is
therefore possible to use this method to analyze the position of nucleosomes across that genome in a particular cell type and investigate how this
changes under different conditions.
A more precise method of analysis of the positioning of nucleosomes
across the genome relies on chemically modifying histone H4 within the
nucleosome to convert the serine amino acid at position 47 to a cysteine.
Subsequently, a reactive chemical group is attached to this cysteine, rendering it reactive with a mixture of hydrogen peroxide and copper. Because
of its position within histone H4, the modified cysteine residue is in close
contact with the DNA base over which the nucleosome is centered. When
the reactive group is exposed to hydrogen peroxide and copper, hydroxyl
radicals are generated which cleave the DNA at the bases adjacent to
the base over which the nucleosome is centered. DNA sequence analysis
of the DNA fragments generated in this way, thus allows very precise

The micrococcal nuclease method and the more precise chemical modification method produce results in general agreement with one another.
Taken together, they have allowed the mapping of nucleosome positions
across whole genomes and analysis of the manner in which chromatin
remodeling complexes can alter such positioning under different conditions. This is of critical importance in the regulation of gene expression
since, as discussed in Chapter 3 (Section 3.5), the positioning of nucleosomes will control whether specific DNA-binding proteins can gain access
to their appropriate binding sites in the chromatin.

a reactive group (asterisk) is attached to a cysteine amino acid that has

hydrogen peroxide (h2o2) and copper (cu) results in cleavage of the Dna
at the nucleotides (–1 and +1) on either side of the nucleotide over which
the nucleosome is centered (0) (c). Subsequent isolation and sequencing
of the Dna fragments generated in this way allow a precise determination
of nucleosome positioning at single nucleotide resolution.

Interestingly, as well as altering the association of DNA with the histone
octamer, chromatin remodeling complexes can also promote the exchange
of histone molecules within a histone octamer so that pre-existing histone
molecules are replaced with new ones (Figure 2.18). This can involve the
loss of a histone H2A-H2B heterodimer and its replacement by another
H2A-H2B dimer (Figure 2.18a). Alternatively, it can involve the loss of the
complete histone octamer (consisting of two molecules of H2A, H2B, H3,
and H4) followed by replacement with a new octamer of the core histones
(Figure 2.18b).
This loss and subsequent replacement of all or part of the histone
octamer would be somewhat pointless if like was always replaced with like.
However, as discussed in the next section, the histones are subject to various post-translational modifications which alter their properties.
Moreover, variant forms of the histones also exist. Exchange of histones
catalyzed by remodeling complexes can therefore have significant effects
in terms of gene regulation.

the interaction of the histones with the DNA itself or with other histone
molecules in adjacent nucleosomes (Figure 2.19).
In many cases, individual histone molecules will show multiple different
modifications. As described below, this leads to the idea of a “histone code”
in which the overall pattern of modification of individual histone molecules
plays a key role in the regulation of chromatin structure. The different
post-translational modifications of the histones will be discussed in turn.

(a) Acetylation
In the process of acetylation, the free amino group on specific lysine residues is modified by one of the hydrogen atoms being substituted by an
acetyl group (COCH3). This reduces the net positive charge on the histone
molecule (Figure 2.20). Such acetylation modifies multiple specific lysine
residues at the N-terminus of each of the four core histones (Figure 2.21).
Thus, each of the histones can exist in multiple forms with none, one or
multiple acetylated lysine residues.

Chapter 2: Structure of Chromatin

The acetylation of histones is catalyzed by enzymes, known as histone
acetyltransferases (HATs). These are part of multiprotein complexes
containing a variety of proteins including the catalytic subunit which actually acetylates the histones. A variety of HATs exist and are classified into
three major families, the gNATs (gcn5 N-acetyltransferases), the p300/CBP
family, and the MyST family (named for its founder members Morf, ybf2,
Sas2, and Tip60).
Interestingly, the founder member of the gNAT family, the yeast protein
gcn5, had previously been characterized as a protein involved in transcription before its HAT activity was characterized. Similarly, p300/CBP were
defined as key transcriptional co-activator proteins before their HAT activity was characterized (see Chapter 5, Section 5.2, for further discussion of
gcn5 and CBP/p300). These findings are consistent with the data discussed
in Chapter 3 (Section 3.3), which indicate the importance of histone acetylation in the control of chromatin structure and therefore in the regulation of
transcription.
The action of HAT enzymes is opposed by histone deacetylase enzymes
(HDACs) which remove the acetyl group from the lysine amino acids, with
the balance of activity controlling the level of histone acetylation
(Figure 2.22). As with HATs, the HDACs are multiprotein complexes with
well-characterized examples including the Sin3 complex and the NuRD
complex. Moreover, as with HATs, HDAC components had previously been
shown to be involved in transcription even before their HDAC activity had
been defined. For example, HDAC1, the first mammalian HDAC to be characterized, was shown to be homologous to Rpd3, a yeast protein identified
on the basis that it repressed transcription.

(b) ​Methylation
As with acetylation, methylation targets lysine residues at the N-terminus of
the histone molecule. However, in the methylation process rather than
replacing a hydrogen atom with an acetyl group one, two or three hydrogen
atoms are replaced with methyl (CH3) groups to form methyl-lysine,
dimethyl-lysine or trimethyl-lysine (Figure 2.23). In addition, unlike acetylation, methylation can also target arginine residues. Moreover, unlike
acetylation, methylation does not reduce the net positive charge on these
basic amino acids.

Methylation can occur at multiple lysine or arginine residues at the
N-terminus of each of the four histones H2A, H2B, H3, and H4. The residues
in histones H3 and H4 that can be methylated are shown in Figure 2.24. As
with acetylation (also shown in Figure 2.24), none, one or multiple specific
residues can be methylated in any individual histone molecule.
Interestingly, as seen in Figure 2.24, some lysine residues can be modified by either methylation or acetylation. As such modifications target the
same atoms of the lysine molecule (compare Figures 2.20 and 2.23) they are
mutually exclusive and such residues can either be acetylated or methylated
(or unmodified) in any individual histone molecule (Figure 2.25).
In addition to such alternative modification of individual amino acids,
modifications at one site often influence modifications at other sites. For
example, methylation of histone H3 at position 9 in the amino-terminus not
only prevents acetylation at this position but also inhibits acetylation at
position 14. Conversely, demethylation at position 9 is frequently accompanied by acetylation at position 14 (Figure 2.26).
Methylation of histones is catalyzed by specific histone methylase
enzymes which methylate either arginine or lysine residues. As with acetyl
groups (see above) methyl groups can also be removed from histones and
enzymes that catalyze such demethylation have been identified.
The demethylation event can take place via different mechanisms
depending on the enzyme involved. For example, in the case of methylated
lysine residues, the lSD1 enzyme catalyzes an amine oxidase reaction in
which hydrogen atoms are removed and transferred to the FAD co-factor.
This produces an imine intermediate, which then undergoes a deimination
to produce unmethylated lysine and formaldehyde (Figure 2.27a). The
lSD1 enzyme can remove the methyl groups from monomethyl and
dimethyl-lysine but not from trimethyl-lysine.
In contrast, the JmjC demethylase enzymes act on trimethyl-lysine, as well
as the monomethyl and dimethyl forms using a different mechanism to that
employed by lSD1. This mechanism involves an oxidative demethylation
reaction which releases succinate and CO2. This produces a hydroxymethyl
intermediate which then releases formaldehyde to leave a demethylated
lysine (Figure 2.27b).
Although these enzymes use different mechanisms involving either
deimination or demethylation, the result is the same and demonstrates that
as with acetylation, histone methylation is a reversible process.
As well as the well-characterized phenomenon of methylation of lysine
or arginine residues in the histones, methylation of H2A is observed on the
glutamine residues at positions 104 and 105. Interestingly, this modification occurs only on nucleosomes which are associated with the genes
encoding the ribosomal RNAs. As these genes are transcribed by RNA
polymerase I (see Chapter 4, Section 4.1), this represents the first reported
modification that is specific to the genes transcribed by a particular RNA
polymerase.

Ubiquitination and SUMOylation

As well as being modified by acetylation or methylation of their free amino
group, lysine residues can also be modified by ubiquitination of this amino
group. unlike other modifications however, ubiquitination does not involve
the addition of a small chemical group such as a methyl or acetyl residue.
Rather, it involves the linkage of a lysine residue in the histone to the free
amino group of the 76 amino acid protein ubiquitin to form a branched
molecule (Figure 2.28).
U

Although in some other proteins the addition of ubiquitin targets a
protein for degradation, this is not the case for ubiquitinated H2A and
H2B, which remain stable proteins. As with acetylation however, ubiquitination reduces the positive charge on the histone molecules since it
removes the positive charge on the modified lysine residue. In addition,

HISTONE MODIFICATIONS AND HISTONE ­VARIANTS
the ubiquitin protein itself contains a number of negatively charged amino
acids that can neutralize the positively charged amino acids in the histone molecule.
As with the other modifications discussed so far, ubiquitination of histones can affect the modification of histones at other positions. Interestingly,
ubiquitination of histone H2B actually promotes the methylation of a different histone, H3, at the lysines located at positions 4 and 79. This may occur
because ubiquitination of H2B changes the conformation of the histone H3
N-terminal region within the nucleosome to make it more accessible to
histone methyltransferases (Figure 2.29a) or because such ubiquitination enhances the recruitment of such methyltransferases which then
methylate histone H3 within the nucleosome (Figure 2.29b). Hence, individual histone modifications can promote further modifications of the
same histone molecule as discussed above for acetylation/methylation
(Figure 2.30a) or can promote the modification of a different histone
(Figure 2.30b).
As well as being modified by addition of ubiquitin, lysine residues on
histones can also be modified by addition of SUMO (small ubiquitin-related
modifier), which as its name suggests is a small protein related to ubiquitin.
Interestingly, it appears that sumoylation of histones can lead to the recruitment of histone deacetylase enzymes. This results in deacetylation of the
sumoylated histone, providing another link between two different histone
modifications (Figure 2.31).

As with acetylation and methylation, phosphorylation occurs for all four
core histones, (H2A, H2B, H3, and H4) and occurs at the N-terminus of the
protein close to the acetylated and methylated lysine residues. The pattern
of phosphorylation, methylation, and acetylation at the N-terminus of histones H3 and H4 is illustrated in Figure 2.32.
The close association of these various modifications results in interaction between them. For example, phosphorylation of histone H3 on serine
10 is associated with acetylation of the adjacent lysine 14. Indeed, the
demethylation of position 9 in histone H3 described above (see Figure 2.26)
is accompanied not only by acetylation of lysines 9 and 14 but also by the
phosphorylation of serine 10 (Figure 2.33).
Since the added phosphate molecule is negatively charged, phosphorylation like acetylation or ubiquitination will partially neutralize the net positive charge of the modified histone molecules and therefore affect their
ability to interact with the negatively charged DNA or with other histones
in adjacent nucleosomes (Figure 2.34a).

Chapter 2: Structure of Chromatin

In addition to such charge effects however, it is also likely that posttranslational modifications of the histones such as phosphorylation affect
their interaction with regulatory proteins. Indeed, the linkage between the
different modifications that has been described throughout this section has
led to the idea of a “histone code” in which individual regulatory proteins
may recognize multiple modifications on histone molecules (Figure 2.34b)
(compare Figure 2.19 and Figure 2.34).

Other histone modifications

The findings discussed above indicating a histone code of multiple different
histone modifications with the different modifications interacting with one
another have been reinforced by the identification more recently of further
histone modifications.
Thus, for example, it has been demonstrated that the serine amino
acid at position 112 of histone H2B can be modified by the addition of a
sugar residue O-linked N-acetylglucosamine (G1cNAc). In turn, this
modification promotes the ubiquitination of H2B on lysine 120 which, as
discussed above, in turn stimulates methylation of histone H3. Hence,
cascades of modifications may exist in which different modifications successively stimulate modification of the same or other histone molecules
(Figure 2.35).
These conclusions are further reinforced by a comprehensive study that
used a mass spectrometry approach to identify as many histone modifications as possible. A number of novel target amino acids for acetylation or
methylation were identified in specific histones. Moreover, the study also
identified two novel histone modifications, namely addition of hydroxyl
(OH) groups to tyrosine residues and the modification of lysine residues by
crotonylation (addition of a C4H5O group).
Overall therefore, the studies described in this section indicate a highly
complex pattern of histone modification with the different modifications
interacting with one another. As discussed in Chapter 3 (Section 3.4), this
“histone code” plays a role in the regulation of chromatin structure and
hence in the control of gene expression.

Histone variants are encoded by distinct genes to those
encoding the standard histone isoforms
The standard isoforms of the four core histones (H2A, H2B, H3, and H4),
whether modified by post-translational modifications or not, constitute the
great bulk of the histones in the cell. However, in all cases except H4, minor
variant forms of the histones exist which show a number of amino acid
differences from the standard forms of the histones. The degree of similarity
between a particular variant and the standard form of the histone can be
very different (Figure 2.36). For example, the histone H3 variant, CENP-A
shows only 46% identity with histone H3, whereas another H3 variant H3.3
differs by only four amino acids from H3, making it 96% identical. The variant forms of the histones are encoded by different genes from those encoding the standard forms of the histones and are less well conserved
evolutionarily than the standard forms.

Nonetheless, these different histone variants have important functions
in particular chromosomal processes where nucleosome remodeling
(see Section 2.2 and Figure 2.18) results in their replacing one or more of
the standard histones. For example, the H3 variant CENP-A plays a key role
in organizing chromatin structure at the centromere, the specialized
region by which the chromosome attaches to the spindle during cell division (see Section 2.5).
Similarly, the H2A variant, H2AX, is associated with regions where DNA
damage needs to be repaired. H2AX has a C-terminal region that is not
found in H2A (Figure 2.36) and this region contains a serine residue that can
be phosphorylated. It appears that phosphorylation of this serine acts as a
marker of damaged DNA and recruits the enzymes required for DNA repair
(Figure 2.37). In agreement with this, loss of H2AX leads to increased
chromosomal rearrangements due to the failure to repair damaged DNA.
This example therefore combines the use of a variant histone with its modification by phosphorylation.
In terms of our primary interest in gene control, the most interesting
histone variants are the H2A variant, H2AZ, and the H3 variant, H3.3. Both
these variants appear to localize to regions where genes are being actively
transcribed and may therefore play a role in producing a more open chromatin structure. Nucleosomes containing either H2AZ or H3.3 in place of
H2A or H3, respectively, appear to be more unstable than standard nucleosomes. This instability is enhanced in nucleosomes containing both H2AZ

Although the beads-on-a-string structure discussed in Section 2.2 produces a compaction of the DNA by winding it around the histone octamer,
further compaction is still required. Indeed, when carefully extracted from
cells using buffers with the same salt concentration as is found in the cell,
chromatin is seen as a fiber of approximately 30 nm in diameter. This is a
shorter, more compact structure than the 10 nm diameter, beads-on-astring form that is isolated under conditions of low ionic strength (see
Section 2.2). This indicates that the nucleosomes have associated more
closely together to form a shorter, but thicker fiber. Although some
researchers have suggested that the 30 nm fiber is an artifact produced by
the techniques used to isolate chromatin, the consensus in the field is that
it does exist in intact cells as an important form of condensed chromatin
whose structure needs to be understood.
Initial studies of the structure of the 30 nm fiber suggested that it had a
solenoid structure (Figure 2.39). In this structure, the linear array of
nucleosomes in the beads on a string is thrown into a helical structure in
which nucleosomes are stacked above one another, producing a more compact structure. As this structure is a single helix with only one starting point,
it is known as the one start helix.
More recently however, studies of the crystal structure of a tetranucleosome (four successive nucleosomes linked by DNA) have suggested an
alternative structure, which is known as the two start helix (Figure 2.40).
In this model, the nucleosomes form a zigzag ribbon structure, with alternative nucleosomes being in different strands of the ribbon. The two
strands of the ribbon are then wound into a double-helical ribbon structure
(Figure 2.41). This has two strands of nucleosomes wound around one
another and is therefore known as a two start helix.
Although the density of the 30 nm fiber itself makes it difficult to determine its structure exactly, it appears that the two start model is more likely
to be correct. As well as being based on structural studies of the tetranucleosome, it also agrees with cross-linking studies on arrays of 12 nucleosomes.

These suggested that the 30 nm fiber contains 2 rows of 6 nucleosomes
rather than a single stack of 12 nucleosomes.

Histone H1 and post-translational modifications of the other
histones are involved in the formation of the 30 nm fiber
The 30 nm fiber structure represents the next stage of compaction after the
beads-on-a-string structure and it is therefore of importance to understand
the factors involved in producing this structure from the 10 nm beads-on-astring structure. Moreover, as will be discussed in Chapter 3 (Section 3.1),
DNA that is about to be transcribed adopts the beads-on-a-string structure.
The factors that control the interconversion of the 10 nm and 30 nm fibers
are of critical importance therefore in terms of both chromatin structure and
gene control.
It appears that the histone modifications, discussed in Section 2.3 play a
critical role in the transition between the 30 nm fiber and the beads-on-astring structure. As noted above, the amino-terminal ends of the core
histones extend as tails from the nucleosome particle, allowing them to
promote the interactions between adjacent nucleosomes that are required
to form higher order chromatin structures.
It has been shown for example, that the positively charged region at the
amino-terminus of histone H4 and particularly the lysine at position 16
interacts with a negatively charged cluster of seven amino acids on the
surface of histone H2A/H2B in the adjacent nucleosome. This has the effect
of pulling adjacent nucleosomes together (Figure 2.42a). As noted in
Section 2.3, lysine 16 of histone H4 is a target for modification by acetylation. This reduces the positive charge on this region of H4 and potentially
weakens the interaction with the negatively charged region of H2A/H2B in

the adjacent nucleosome and so promotes a more open chromatin structure
(Figure 2.42b).
Histone H1 also plays a critical role in promoting the more tightly
packed chromatin structure in the 30 nm fiber. Indeed as illustrated in Figure
2.12, when visualized in the electron microscope chromatin appears much
more tightly packed in the presence of histone H1 than in its absence.
As indicated in Table 2.1, histone H1 is present in the cell in half the
amount of each of the four core histones and it is not part of the histone
octamer. Rather, it is present at the level of one molecule per nucleosome.
It is thought that the central globular region of histone H1 contacts the
linker DNA as it exits from the nucleosome and changes its path to form a
more compact structure (Figure 2.43). This has the effect of sealing the
two turns that the DNA makes around the octamer of the core histones and
appears to be crucial for the formation of the 30 nm fiber.
In agreement with this idea, histone H1 is enriched in regions of DNA that
are not being transcribed whereas it is depleted in regions where transcription is occurring and that have a less tightly packed chromatin structure.
Interestingly, it has been shown that the presence of histone H1 inhibits the
recruitment of a histone methyltransferase, which normally methylates histone H3 on lysine 4, whereas it promotes the recruitment of DNA methyltransferase enzymes, which methylate the DNA associated with
H1-containing nucleosomes (Figure 2.44a). As demethylation of H3 lysine
4 and methylation of DNA are associated with inactive tightly packed chromatin (see Chapter 3, Sections 3.2 and 3.3) this provides a mechanism for
the role of histone H1 in promoting a more condensed chromatin structure.

histone h1 promotes the recruitment of Dna methyltransferases (Dnmt) and inhibits the recruitment of histone methyltransferases (hMt)
thereby promoting a more tightly packed chromatin structure (a). in contrast, the h3.3 variant of histone h3 inhibits recruitment of h1 to
the nucleosome thereby promoting a more open chromatin structure (b).

STRUCTURAL AND FUNCTIONAL DOMAINS IN CHROMATIN
Conversely, it has been shown that the histone variant H3.3 inhibits
recruitment of histone H1 to nucleosomes (Figure 2.44b). This will therefore maintain a more open chromatin structure, consistent with the association of histone H3.3 with such a structure which was discussed above
(Section 2.3).
It is clear therefore, that both histone H1 and post-translational modifications of the core histones play key roles in the transition between the
30 nm fiber and the 10 nm beads-on-a-string structure, with this transition
being required for transcription to occur.
Interestingly, in mature chicken erythrocytes, histone H1 is replaced by
histone H5, which produces a very highly compact chromatin structure
from which no transcription occurs. This reduces the portion of the cell
occupied by the nucleus and allows the maximum space in the erythrocyte
for its primary function, namely carrying oxygen. It therefore fulfils the
same purpose as the total loss of the nucleus which occurs in mature mammalian erythrocytes (see Chapter 1, Section 1.3).

The 30 nm fiber is further compacted by looping
Although the 30 nm fiber is the fundamental structure packaging most of
the DNA in the cell, it appears not to exist as a simple linear structure.
Rather, it is thrown into a series of loops of different sizes but normally each
containing between 50,000 and 200,000 base pairs of DNA (Figure 2.45).
As in the conversion of the 10 nm beads-on-a-string structure into the
30 nm fiber, this looped structure is shorter and thicker than the 30 nm fiber.

This method can be used to identify the long range of interactions that
may occur between regions of DNA that are separated by significant distances along the linear chromosome. It can therefore be used in the analysis of DNA packing within condensed chromatin (see below) or to analyze
the interaction of a gene with distant regulatory sequences such as
enhancers (see Chapter 4, Section 4.4).
Although the 3C method was initially used to identify the interactions of
a specific piece of DNA with other adjacent regions, its scope can be
extended by combining it with high-throughput DNA sequencing to analyze
the linked DNA fragments it produces. In this way, the interactions of a piece
of DNA with all the rest of the genome can be analyzed (known as the 4C
method) or the interaction of multiple DNA regions with multiple other DNA
regions can be characterized (known as the 5C method). It is now possible
therefore, to produce a looping/interaction map of the entire genome in
specific cells and under specific conditions. Moreover, by analyzing the
effect of deleting specific proteins on the looping pattern, it has been possible to identify specific proteins such as CTCF and cohesion, which play a key
role in producing the higher order looped structure of chromatin.
Interestingly a number of the loops characterized in this way have been
shown to be attached to the nuclear matrix, a network of RNA and protein
fibrils that extends throughout the entire nucleus. Attachment is mediated
via specific AT-rich regions of DNA, known as matrix attachment regions
(MARs) or scaffold attachment regions (SARs), which are located at the
base of the DNA loops (Figure 2.47).
Each of these loops therefore constitutes a structural domain of the chromatin. In some but not all cases these structural domains appear to correspond to functional domains in which a particular loop of DNA moves from
the 30 nm fiber structure to the beads-on-a-string structure, before the onset
of transcription itself (Figure 2.48). As will be discussed in Chapter 4 (Section
4.1), such looping also allows DNA that is about to be active to extend outwards from the bulk of the chromatin, allowing it to localize to specific
regions of the nucleus where transcription actually occurs (see Figure 4.25).

Specific functional domains of chromatin thus exist in which chromatin
structure is altered in a particular situation to allow transcription to occur.
The existence of such functional domains, whether or not they correspond
to structural domains, raises the question of how their boundaries are
defined allowing two regions of chromatin adjacent to one another to have
two distinct structures, i.e. the beads-on-a-string structure and the 30 nm
fiber structure.
Two types of DNA elements that mediate these boundary effects will be
discussed in turn.

Locus control regions regulate the chromatin structure
of a large region of DNA
When specific genes are introduced into fertilized mouse eggs and used to
create transgenic mice, the introduced genes are frequently expressed at
very low levels and this expression is not increased when multiple copies of
the genes are introduced. Similarly, identical copies of the introduced gene
which integrate into the host chromosomes at different positions are
expressed at very different levels, suggesting that gene activity is being
influenced by adjacent chromosomal regions. This effect occurs even when
the gene is introduced together with its adjacent regulatory elements. This
has led to the concept that some DNA sequences, which are necessary for
high level gene expression independent of the position of the gene in the
genome, are absent from the introduced gene.
This idea has been supported by studies in the mammalian β-globin
gene cluster, which contains a non-functional pseudogene and four functional β-globin-like genes that are expressed successively with α-globin in
erythroid cells during the development of the organism. Thus, ε-globin is
expressed in the early embryo, the two γ-globin genes (which differ at only
a single position where gγ has a glycine and Aγ has an alanine) in the later
embryo, and β-globin (together with a small amount of δ-globin) in the adult
(Figure 2.49).

A region located 10–20 kilobases upstream of the β-globin genes has
been shown to confer high-level, position-independent expression when
linked to a single globin gene and introduced into transgenic mice.
Moreover, this element acts in a tissue-specific manner since its presence
allows the globin gene to be expressed in the correct pattern with high-level
expression in erythroid cells and not in other cell types.
Most importantly this element is not only required for expression of the
β-globin genes in transgenic mice but also plays a role in the natural expression of the globin genes. Its deletion in human individuals leads to a lack of
expression of any of the genes in the cluster, resulting in a lethal disease
known as Hispanic thalassemia in which no functional hemoglobin is produced (Figure 2.49). This occurs even in cases where all the genes together
with their promoter and enhancer regions remain intact.
The role of this element in stimulating activity of all the genes in the
β-globin cluster has led to its being called a locus control region (LCR).
Following the original definition of an lCR in the β-globin cluster, similar
lCR elements have been identified in other genes including the α-globin
cluster, the major histocompatibility locus, and the CD2 and lysozyme
genes. It is clear that lCRs constitute an important element essential for the
correct regulation of gene expression.
It is likely that lCRs function by directing a structural change in a
region of chromatin into a more open chromatin structure in specific
cell types. In the β-globin case, this would occur in erythroid cells allowing the β-globin-like genes to be successively expressed in embryonic
development and in the adult. In agreement with this, in many cases
regions with lCR activity do not affect gene activity when introduced
transiently into cells under conditions where the exogenous DNA is not
packaged into chromatin but can do so when the same gene construct
integrates into the host chromosome.
The presence of the lCR would render the adjacent DNA capable of being
expressed in a position-independent manner, allowing high-level
tissue-specific expression of the gene in transgenic mice regardless of the
position in the genome into which it integrated. In contrast, a gene lacking
this sequence would lack this stimulatory action and would be subject to the
influence of adjacent regulatory elements which might inhibit its expression
(Figure 2.50). In agreement with this idea, a transgene containing the CD2
locus control region is not inactivated when inserted into a tightly packed
region of the DNA known as heterochromatin (see below), whereas this
does occur when the same gene is inserted into this region without the lCR.
The link between lCRs and chromatin structure has been supported by
detailed studies of the β-globin gene cluster at different stages of erythroid
development. It has been shown that in early erythroid development, the

cluster forms a looped structure in which the active γ-globin genes are
brought into close proximity with the lCR. In contrast, later in erythroid
development at the stage when β-globin itself is expressed, the loop structure changes so that it is now the active β-globin and δ-globin genes which
are associated with the lCR (Figure 2.51). This has led to the idea of an
active chromatin hub at which the regulatory elements in the lCR are
brought together with regulatory elements of the individual gene itself to
ensure that each gene is actively transcribed at the appropriate stage of
development.
Interestingly, a number of lCRs also contain MAR sequences (see
above). It is clear therefore that the lCR plays a key role in directing looping
of the chromatin into structural and functional domains attached to the
nuclear scaffold, with the chromatin structure of each domain being regulated as a separate unit. In agreement with this idea, the MAR sequences
contained within the lCR of the immunoglobulin gene have been shown to
enhance the accessibility of the adjacent chromatin in B lymphocytes but
not in other cell types.

The existence of elements such as lCRs that can alter the chromatin structure of large regions of the chromosome leads to the question of how the
action of such elements is confined to the appropriate gene or genes. Some
mechanism must exist to prevent the effect of lCRs from spreading to other
genes in adjacent regions of the chromosome and producing an inappropriate pattern of gene expression. Similarly, as will be discussed in Chapter 4
(Section 4.4), many genes contain enhancer elements that are able to act
over long distances and that must also have their activity limited to specific
regions of DNA so as to prevent inappropriate effects.
This problem is solved by the existence of insulator sequences, which as
their name implies, block the spread of lCR or enhancer activity so that it is
confined to the appropriate gene or genes and other adjacent genes are
“insulated” from these effects. As shown in Figure 2.52, the region containing the lCR and the β-globin genes is flanked by two insulator sequences
known as HS4 sequences, which prevent the lCR from inappropriately activating the flanking genes encoding the folate receptor and the odorant
receptor gene (Figure 2.52).
As with lCRs, insulator sequences can also allow position-independent
expression of an inserted gene in transgenic mice. Thus, they will prevent
the spread of a closed chromatin structure from an adjacent region, allowing a transgene, for example, to be expressed regardless of the site in the
genome where it has inserted.

insulators block the spread of a particular structure from or to adjacent DNA
regions (Figure 2.52).
Interestingly, a wide variety of insulator sequences have been shown to
bind the CTCF protein, which is known to play a key role in producing the
looping of DNA within the chromatin (see above). For example, CTCF binds
to both the insulator sequences flanking the β-globin gene cluster discussed
above. It is likely that interaction between CTCF molecules bound at each
of the flanking insulators plays a key role in organizing the looped structure
of the cluster in early erythroid cells which excludes the flanking folate
receptors and odorant receptor genes from the transcriptionally/active
region (Figure 2.53). Another example in which CTCF regulates chromatin structure by binding an insulator element, which in this case is located
in the Igf2/H19 gene cluster, will be discussed in Chapter 3 (Section 3.6).

Heterochromatin is a very tightly packed form of chromatin
As well as preventing the inappropriate spread of open chromatin structure
such as that produced by lCRs, insulators can also block the inappropriate
spread of highly compact chromatin structures (Figure 2.54). For example,
insulators can mark the boundary between the bulk of chromatin in the cell
which is known as euchromatin and more compacted regions known as
heterochromatin (Figure 2.54a). These regions were originally defined on
the basis that heterochromatin is more condensed than euchromatin during
the interphase stage when cells are not dividing and therefore stains more
intensely with specific stains used in light microscopy.
Euchromatin contains most of the DNA in the cell and is packaged in the
looped form of the 30 nm fiber. Euchromatin contains the regions of DNA
that will be transcribed in specific cell types or under particular conditions.
As noted above and described in more detail in Chapter 3 (Section 3.1),
when particular regions of euchromatin are about to be transcribed they
move into the more open beads-on-a-string structure allowing transcription to occur.
In contrast, approximately 10% of the cell is packaged in a more compact form known as heterochromatin, which is incompatible with transcription. Where an insulator is lost due to deletion or a chromosome
translocation, the more compact structure of heterochromatin can spread
into the adjacent euchromatin. This will silence the genes in the adjoining
region, preventing them from being expressed at the appropriate place or
time (Figure 2.54b).
Interestingly, when this occurs in the early Drosophila embryo the heterochromatin randomly spreads to a different extent in different cells, resulting
in different numbers of adjacent genes being silenced (Figure 2.55). As
these cells proliferate in embryonic development, they maintain this pattern
of gene silencing, resulting in a phenomenon known as position effect
variegation in which different groups of cells in the adult show different patterns of expressed and nonexpressed genes (Figure 2.55).
Heterochromatin has a more extensive looped structure compared with
that found in euchromatin, with much tighter packing of the loops. Several
non-histone proteins play a key role in the assembly of heterochromatin
and these include heterochromatin protein one (HP1) and members of the
polycomb group of proteins. Interestingly, different forms of heterochromatin appear to exist which contain different combinations of these proteins.
For example, studies in Drosophila have identified regions of heterochromatin containing HP1 and polycomb proteins, either HP1 or polycomb
alone or neither protein (see Chapter 3, Sections 3.3 and 3.4 for further
discussion of the role of HP1 and polycomb proteins in the regulation of
chromatin structure).

The chromosome is the visible result of chromatin
compaction

and the telomeres at the ends of the DNA molecule (Figure 2.56). As
noted in Section 2.3, the histone H3 variant, CENP-A plays a key role in the
formation of centromeric heterochromatin.
As cells prepare for cell division, the entire DNA molecule undergoes
further compaction, in a process involving proteins known as condensins, to form the chromosomes. The structure of such chromosomes has
recently been analyzed using the techniques for studying the interaction
of different DNA regions described above (see Methods Box 2.2 and Figure
2.46). In this way the chromosome has been shown to have a specific
looped structure in which the loops are very densely packed together.
Due to their very compact nature, the chromosomes are visible under the
light microscope (Figure 2.56 and Figure 2.57). This compact structure is
incompatible with gene expression but facilitates the accurate partitioning of the replicated DNA to the daughter cells produced by cell division.

CONCLUSIONS
The extended form of DNA in the double-helical structure would be vastly too
large to fit into the cell or even the organism. In this chapter, we have seen
how the DNA undergoes a series of compactions in association with specific
proteins to form the looped structure of interphase chromatin and ultimately,
the chromosomes which are visible during cell division (Figure 2.58). This
allows the double-helical DNA of a single cell, which would have a length of
2 meters if fully extended, to fit within the nucleus which has a diameter of 6
microns (6 micrometers).
Most importantly however, this progressive hierarchy in chromatin
structure is also used in the regulation of gene expression. For example,
genes that are active or potentially active in a particular cell type move
into the more open beads-on-a-string structure from the 30 nm fiber

characteristic of non-active genes. The information on chromatin structure described in this chapter is therefore essential to our understanding of
the role of chromatin structure in the regulation of gene transcription,
which is discussed in the next chapter.

KeY CONCepTS
•

In eukaryotes, short-term gene control processes need to interact
with long-term processes which determine the commitment of
cells to become or remain a particular differentiated cell type.

•

Such long-term control processes involve the manner in which
particular regions of DNA are packaged with proteins into a
structure known as chromatin.

•

Packaging DNA into chromatin compacts it, so allowing it to fit
within the nucleus, but is also used to regulate gene expression.

•

The negatively charged DNA associates with positively charged
histone proteins to allow such compaction to occur.

•

The first level of compaction involves association of the DNA with
the core histones H2A, H2B, H3, and H4 to form a structure
known as the nucleosome.

•

This produces a 10 nm fiber with a beads-on-a-string structure of
nucleosomes and DNA.

•

The histones can be modified by various post-translational
modifications and variant forms also exist which play different
roles.

•

Further compaction, involving histone H1 and regulation of
histone modification, produces a 30 nm fiber with a helical
structure of nucleosomes.

•

This 30 nm fiber is further compacted by forming loops which are
very closely packed in heterochromatin and in the mitotic
chromosome, producing the most compact form of chromatin.

•

Locus control regions regulate the chromatin structure of a region
of DNA.

•

Insulator sequences prevent the inappropriate spread of chromatin
structure to adjacent DNA regions.

The Epigenome: Role of Chromatin
Structure in Gene Control
INTRODUCTION
As discussed in Chapter 1, the processes that control gene expression during cellular differentiation cannot be irreversible since it is possible for the
DNA genome of a differentiated cell to give rise to an entire organism containing a wide variety of different cell types. This can occur for example,
when differentiated plant cells are cultured under certain conditions or
when the nucleus of differentiated animal cells is transplanted into an
oocyte (see Chapter 1, Section 1.3).
Similarly, under certain conditions one type of differentiated cell can
give rise to a different differentiated cell type. This is seen for example, in
Amphibia in a process known as Wolffian lens regeneration or transdifferentiation. If the lens of the eye is surgically removed in a frog, the adjacent
iris cells surrounding the lens lose their differentiated characteristics, proliferate, and then differentiate into lens cells to replace those that have been
lost. The new lens cells are indistinguishable from the original lens cells in
their pattern of gene expression, expressing for example high levels of proteins such as crystallins, which are the major lens proteins.
Gene regulatory processes must therefore be reversible and this eliminates models such as DNA loss (see Chapter 1, Section 1.3). Nonetheless,
such processes must be stable. In general one type of differentiated cell
does not spontaneously change into a different cell type. Similarly, in many
cases where differentiated cells undergo cell division, their differentiated
characteristics are inherited by the resulting daughter cells.
As well as explaining the stability of the differentiated state, these longterm gene regulatory processes must also explain the experiments discussed
in Chapter 2 (Section 2.1), which indicate that cells undergo a process of
commitment to a particular differentiated state before actually differentiating. Moreover, they can maintain such commitment even when placed
under conditions where they lose the phenotypic features of the differentiated state (see Chapter 2, Section 2.1).
The stable but reversible nature of long-term regulatory processes has
led to the idea that they involve changes in the structure of chromatin.
These changes would facilitate transcription of specific genes and would
occur before the actual process of gene transcription. Rather than involving
irreversible changes to the DNA sequence itself, this would involve stable
but reversible modifications of the DNA or of chromatin proteins, such as
histones with which it is associated (Figure 3.1).
These reversible modifications are referred to as epigenetic changes.
“Epi” is Greek for on and these changes are superimposed on the DNA rather
than representing genetic changes in the DNA itself. Hence, an organism
will inherit a genomic DNA sequence from its two parents and this will generally be identical in its different constituent cells (see Chapter 1, Section 1.3).

Chapter 3: The Epigenome: Role of Chromatin Structure in Gene Control

In contrast, modifications to the DNA and/or of the proteins associated with
it result in an epigenome which is subject to variation in different cell types
of the same organism and under different conditions.
Thus, unlike genetic changes, epigenetic changes are potentially reversible and can therefore account for the stable but not irreversible nature of
long-term gene control processes. As we shall discuss later in this chapter,
changes in these epigenetic modifications often require a cell division to
replicate the DNA, which then allows alterations in the modification of the
DNA itself or the proteins associated with it. This requirement relates well to
the observation, discussed in Chapter 1 (Section 1.3) that cultured differentiated phloem cells from plants, dedifferentiate and then proliferate before
giving rise to all the different cells of the plant. Similarly, as noted above, in
Wolffian lens regeneration, differentiated iris cells do not change directly
into lens cells. Rather they first dedifferentiate and proliferate before differentiating into lens cells.
The structure of chromatin discussed in Chapter 2 is a key target for
regulatory processes. These processes produce epigenetic modifications of
the DNA itself and/or the proteins associated with it, which in turn alter
chromatin structure. This chapter will discuss the role of changes in chromatin structure in the regulation of gene transcription and the epigenetic
modifications that are involved in producing these changes.

CHANgeS IN CHROMATIN STRUCTURe IN
ACTIVe OR POTeNTIALLY ACTIVe geNeS

Active DNA is organized in a nucleosomal structure
As discussed in Chapter 2 (Section 2.2), the bulk of cellular DNA is associated with histone molecules in a nucleosomal structure. This leads to the
obvious question as to whether genes that are either being transcribed or
are about to be transcribed in a particular tissue are also organized in this
manner or whether they exist as naked, nucleosome-free DNA.
Two main lines of evidence suggest that actively transcribed genes are
still organized into nucleosomes. First, if DNA that is being transcribed is
examined in the electron microscope, in most cases the characteristic
beads-on-a-string structure (see Chapter 2, Section 2.2) is observed, with
nucleosomes visible both behind and in front of the RNA polymerase molecules transcribing the gene (Figure 3.2). Although this structure may break
down in genes which are being highly actively transcribed, such as occurs

CHANGES IN CHROMATIN STRUCTURE IN ACTIVE OR POTENTIALLY ACTIVE GENES

for the genes encoding ribosomal RNA during oogenesis, it is maintained
in most transcribed genes.
Second, if DNA organized into nucleosomes is isolated as a ladder of
characteristically sized fragments following mild digestion with micrococcal nuclease (see Chapter 2, Section 2.2), the DNA from active genes is
found in these fragments in the same proportion as in total DNA. Similarly,
no enrichment or depletion in the amount of DNA from a particular gene
found in these fragments is observed when the chromatin isolated from a
tissue actively transcribing the gene is analyzed and compared to chromatin isolated from a tissue that does not transcribe it. The ovalbumin gene,
for example, is found in nucleosome-sized fragments of DNA in these
experiments regardless of whether chromatin from hormonally stimulated
oviduct tissue or from liver tissue is used. This is in agreement with the
idea that transcribed DNA is still found in a nucleosomal structure rather
than as naked DNA, which would be rapidly digested by micrococcal nuclease and would not appear in the ladder of nucleosome-sized DNA
fragments.

Active or potentially active chromatin shows enhanced
sensitivity to DNaseI digestion
To identify differences between transcribed and nontranscribed DNA, many
workers have studied the sensitivity of these different regions to digestion
with the pancreatic enzyme deoxyribonuclease I (DNaseI). Although this
enzyme will eventually digest all the DNA in a cell, if it is applied to chromatin in small amounts for a short period, only a small amount of the DNA will
be digested. The proportion of transcribed or nontranscribed genes present
in the relatively resistant undigested DNA in a given tissue compared to the
proportion in total DNA can be used to detect the presence of differences
between active and inactive DNA in their sensitivity to digestion with this
enzyme.
The fate of an individual gene in this procedure can be followed simply
by cutting the DNA surviving digestion with an appropriate restriction
enzyme and carrying out the standard Southern blotting procedure
(Chapter 1, Methods Box 1.1) with a probe derived from the gene of interest.
The presence or absence of the appropriate band derived from the gene in
the digested DNA provides a measure of the resistance of the gene to DNaseI
digestion (Figure 3.3; Methods Box 3.1).

Monitor disappearance of band for DNA of interest in samples where
increasing amounts of DNaseI have been used to digest chromatin.

This procedure has been used to demonstrate that a very wide range of
genes that are active in a particular tissue exhibit a heightened sensitivity to
DNaseI, which extends over the whole of the transcribed gene and for some
distance upstream and downstream of the transcribed region. For example,
when chromatin from chick oviduct tissue is digested, the active ovalbumin
gene is rapidly digested and its characteristic band disappears from the
Southern blot under digestion conditions which leave the DNA from the
inactive globin gene undigested. This difference between the globin and
ovalbumin genes is dependent upon their different activity in oviduct tissue
rather than any inherent difference in the resistance of the genes themselves to digestion. If the digestion is carried out with chromatin isolated
from red blood cell precursors in which the globin gene is active and that
encoding ovalbumin is inactive, the reverse result to that seen in the oviduct
is obtained, with the globin DNA exhibiting preferential sensitivity to digestion and the ovalbumin DNA being resistant to such digestion (Figure 3.3).
It is clear that actively transcribed genes, although packaged into nucleosomes, are in a more open chromatin structure than that found for nontranscribed genes and are hence more accessible to digestion with DNaseI.
This altered chromatin structure is not confined to the very active genes
such as globin and ovalbumin but appears to be a general characteristic of
all transcribed genes, whatever their rate of transcription. If chromatin is
digested using conditions that degrade less than 10% of the total DNA, over
90% of transcriptionally active DNA is digested and the DNA of genes encoding rare mRNAs is as sensitive as that encoding abundant mRNAs. The
altered chromatin structure of active genes does not therefore appear to be
dependent upon the act of transcription itself, since the genes encoding
many rare mRNAs will be transcribed only very occasionally.
In agreement with this idea, the altered DNaseI sensitivity of previously
active genes persists even after transcription has ceased. For example,
preferential sensitivity to DNaseI is observed for the genes encoding the
fetal forms of globin which are not transcribed in adult sheep cells and for
the adult globin genes in mature (14-day) chicken erythrocytes, following
the switching off of transcription. Moreover, as well as being detectable
after transcription has ceased permanently, such increased sensitivity can
also be detected in genes about to become active, before the onset of
transcription – such as the adult globin genes in fetal red blood cells.
The altered more open chromatin structure detected by increased DNaseI
sensitivity does not therefore reflect the act of transcription itself. Rather, it
appears to reflect the ability to be transcribed in a particular tissue or cell
type. In cells that have become committed to a particular lineage expressing particular genes, such commitment will be reflected in an altered chromatin structure which will arise before the onset of transcription and will
persist after transcription has ceased.
The ability of imaginal disc cells in Drosophila to maintain their commitment to give rise to a particular cell type in the absence of overt differentiation (see Chapter 2, Section 2.1) is likely therefore, to be due to the
genes required in that cell type having already assumed an open chromatin
structure. Moreover, a breakdown in this process resulting in a change in
the chromatin structure of a particular regulatory gene would result in a

71

ALTERATIONS IN DNA METHYLATION IN ACTIVE OR POTENTIALLY ACTIVE GENES
change in the commitment of the disc cells, as illustrated in Figure 2.6.
Similarly, the altered chromatin structure of the genes required in cartilage
cells would be retained in cells cultured in media not supporting expression of these genes, allowing the restoration of the differentiated cartilage
phenotype when the cells are transferred to an appropriate medium (see
Chapter 2, Section 2.1).
As described above, active or potentially active DNA is still organized in
the beads-on-a-string nucleosome structure. However, its enhanced DNaseI
sensitivity reflects the fact that it does not form the much more tightly
packed 30 nm fiber structure (Chapter 2, Section 2.4) which is formed by the
bulk of DNA that is not about to be or being transcribed. Commitment to a
particular pattern of gene expression involves a move from the tightly
packed 30 nm fiber structure to the more open beads-on-a-string structure
(Figure 3.4). As the DNA in this structure is more accessible, it is therefore
more readily digested by DNaseI.
Although the greater accessibility to DNaseI of active or potentially active
DNA simply represents an experimental tool for dissecting its chromatin
structure, the alteration of chromatin to this more open structure in committed cells is likely to be a necessary prerequisite for gene expression and is
therefore of major biological significance. It will allow the trans-acting factors
that actually activate transcription of the gene access to their appropriate
DNA target sequences within it. The different structure of potentially active
genes can explain why a particular steroid hormone, such as estrogen, can
induce transcription of the ovalbumin gene in the oviduct but activates the
vitellogenin gene in the liver (see Chapter 2, Introduction). The ovalbumin
gene in the oviduct will be in an open configuration allowing induction to
occur, whereas the more closed configuration of the vitellogenin gene will
not allow access to the hormone/receptor complex and induction will not
occur. The reverse situation would apply in liver tissue allowing induction of
the vitellogenin gene but not the ovalbumin gene.
The changes in chromatin structure detected by DNaseI digestion play
an important role in establishing the commitment to express the specific
genes characteristic of a particular lineage. These changes in chromatin
structure are likely to be produced by a variety of epigenetic changes which
have been observed to modify DNA or its associated proteins in areas that
are about to be or are being transcribed. These biochemical changes are
discussed in the next sections.

3.2 ALTeRATIONS IN DNA MeTHYLATION IN ACTIVe
OR POTeNTIALLY ACTIVe geNeS
Decreased DNA methylation is associated with active or
potentially active genes
Although DNA consists of the four bases adenine, guanine, cytosine, and
thymine, it has been known for many years that these bases can exist in
modified forms bearing additional methyl groups. The most common of
these in eukaryotic DNA is 5-methylcytosine (Figure 3.5). Between 2 and
7% of the cytosine in mammalian DNA is modified in this way. Approximately
90% of this methylated C occurs in the dinucleotide CG, where the methylated C is followed on its 3′ side by a G residue.
Initially the methylation status of specific CG dinucleotides in the genome
was studied by using restriction enzymes whose ability to cut the DNA is
affected by whether the C residue is methylated or unmethylated. In these
studies it was found that although some CG sites are always unmethylated
and others are always methylated, a number of sites exhibit a tissue-specific
methylation pattern, being methylated in some tissues but not in others.
Such sites within a particular gene are unmethylated in tissues where the
gene is active or potentially active and methylated in other tissues. For
example, a particular site within the chicken globin gene is methylated in a
wide variety of tissues but is unmethylated in DNA prepared from red blood
cell precursors. Similarly, the tyrosine amino-transferase gene which is

expressed only in the liver, is relatively under-methylated in this tissue
when compared with other tissues where it is not expressed.
These initial studies have now been greatly extended by methods that
can look at the methylation status of every C residue in the entire genome.
One group of methods for doing this is based on chemical modification of
the DNA using sodium bisulfite. This treatment has no effect on methylated
C residues but converts unmethylated C residues to uracil (U). Hence,
changes in methylation of particular C residues can be detected by using
DNA sequence analysis or by hybridization analysis taking advantage of
the fact that methyl C will bind to G but U will bind to A (Figure 3.6).
To examine all the C residues in the genome the DNA resulting from
such bisulfite treatment can be analyzed by large-scale DNA sequence analysis looking for U residues where there would normally be a C residue.
Alternatively, the bisulfite-treated DNA can also be examined by gene chip
microarray technology (see Chapter 1, Section 1.2), hybridizing it to DNA
chips containing specific oligonucleotides, and looking for U residues
that will bind to an A residue where normally a C residue (binding to a G)
would be detected.
In an alternative to bisulfite-based methods, a modification of the chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assay can be used to analyze the
methylation of C residues in the entire genome. As discussed in Chapter 4
(Section 4.3), this method involves reacting specific antibodies with the
chromatin to isolate, for example, the DNA fragments that are associated
with a particular protein against which the antibody is directed. As antibodies that specifically recognize methylated C residues are available, they can
be used in a modification of the ChIP method to isolate all the DNA fragments containing methylated C residues and high-throughput DNA sequencing used to analyze all such fragments within the genome of a specific cell
type (Figure 3.7).
The results of these experiments reinforce those described above,
namely that demethylation is characteristic of genes that are active or
potentially active. Thus, for example, a recent whole genome study found
that approximately 20% of C residues that were followed by a G residue
exhibited altered methylation during embryonic development and many of
these were located in regions of the DNA that regulate gene expression.
Moreover, high levels of DNA methylation are associated with the inactivation of specific genes both during development and, as discussed in Section
3.6, DNA methylation is also involved in the processes of X-chromosome
inactivation and genomic imprinting.
Interestingly, the promoter regions of many genes have a 10–20 times
higher frequency of CG dinucleotides compared with the rest of the genome.
These so-called CG islands are found particularly in housekeeping genes
which are expressed in all tissues. Moreover, they are frequently unmethylated as would be expected from the link between undermethylation and
gene activity.
These CG islands appear to arise during evolution due to the vulnerability of C residues to naturally occurring deamination processes. When this
occurs for an unmethylated C, it produces a U residue. As U residues do not
normally occur in the DNA, this change is recognized by DNA repair
enzymes which restore the C residue. However, deamination of methyl C
residues produces T residues, which are indistinguishable from normal T
residues (Figure 3.8a) and some of these therefore escape detection by
DNA repair enzymes. Hence, over evolutionary time a high proportion of
meCG dinucleotides may have been converted into TG dinucleotides
(Figure 3.8b), resulting in the CG dinucleotide being underrepresented in
the genome. However, this would not occur in regions where the CG dinucleotide is normally unmethylated, resulting in the clusters of CG residues
that occur in the CG islands found in promoter regions (Figure 3.9).
In the case of tissue-specific genes that exhibit changes in methylation
pattern, undermethylation, like DNaseI sensitivity, is observed before the
onset of transcription and persists after its cessation. For example, the
undermethylation of the chicken globin gene persists in erythrocytes after

Treatment with sodium bisulfite converts
unmethylated cytosine (C) residues to
uracil (u) but has no effect on methylated
C residues. The presence or absence of
methylation on particular C residues can
therefore be analyzed by sodium bisulfite
treatment followed either by DNA sequence
analysis or hybridization to a potentially
complementary DNA sequence, when C will
hybridize to G but u will hybridize to A.

globin gene transcription has ceased, paralleling the continued sensitivity of
the globin gene to DNaseI digestion.
Interestingly, the region in which unmethylated C residues are found in
different genes correlates with that exhibiting heightened DNaseI sensitivity
and is also depleted of histone H1 (see Chapter 2, Section 2.4 for discussion
of histone H1). As with DNaseI sensitivity, therefore, undermethylation is a
consequence of commitment to a particular pattern of gene expression and
is associated with the change in chromatin structure observed in active or
potentially active genes.

DNA methylation plays a key role in regulating chromatin
structure
Although undermethylation is associated with the more open chromatin
structure of active DNA, this association does not prove that it has a key role
in creating this structure. Two lines of evidence indicate however, that this
is indeed the case and that alterations in DNA methylation can affect chromatin structure and gene expression.

5-methylcytosine into cells. A number of such experiments have shown
that such DNA is not expressed, whereas the same DNA which has been
demethylated is expressed. These experiments have been carried out
using both eukaryotic viruses and cellular genes such as those encoding
β- and γ-globin, cloned into plasmid vectors. In these experiments the
methylated DNA adopts a DNaseI-insensitive structure typical of inactive
genes whereas unmethylated DNA adopts the DNaseI-sensitive structure
typical of active genes (Figure 3.10). This provides direct evidence for
the role of methylation differences in regulating the generation of different forms of chromatin structure.
The second line of evidence involves the effect of artificially induced
demethylation of DNA. If methylation differences play a crucial role in the
regulation of differentiation, it should be possible to change gene expression by demethylating DNA. This has been achieved in a number of cases by
treating cells with the cytidine analog, 5-azacytidine. This analog is incorporated into DNA but cannot be methylated, having a nitrogen atom instead
of the carbon atom at position 5 of the pyrimidine ring which is normally the
target for methylation (see Figure 3.5).
In the most dramatic of these cases, treatment of an undifferentiated
fibroblast cell line (known as the 10T ½ cell line) with this compound results
in the activation of key regulatory loci and the cells differentiate into

Over evolutionary time, many C residues at

of C to T. in contrast, C residues at positions
that are unmethylated (bar with open circle)
are retained. Clusters of CG dinucleotides
(CG islands) therefore occur at regions in the
genome, such as gene promoters, where the
C residues are predominantly unmethylated.

multinucleate, twitching, striated muscle cells (see Chapter 10, Section 10.1
for further discussion of this system).
In other cases, although not actually producing altered gene expression,
demethylation may facilitate it. If HeLa cells are treated with 5-azacytidine
no dramatic effects are observed. However, if such cells are fused with muscle cells, muscle-specific genes are switched on in the treated HeLa cells, a
phenomenon that is not observed when untreated HeLa cells are fused with
mouse muscle cells. Thus, treatment of the HeLa cells has altered their
muscle-specific genes in such a way as to allow them to respond to transacting factors present in the mouse muscle cells. This type of regulatory
process is exactly what would be predicted if methylation has a role in the
alteration of chromatin structure and thereby in facilitating interactions
with trans-acting regulatory factors.

DNA methylation patterns can be propagated stably through
cell divisions
The evidence discussed above suggests that DNA methylation plays a central role in the regulation of gene expression, at least in mammals. This
conclusion is reinforced by the finding that several different DNA methyltransferase enzymes that methylate DNA are essential for normal embryonic development. For example, in mammals there are two major
methyltransferase enzymes which can carry out de novo methylation of C
residues, thereby converting an unmethylated site into a methylated one
and both of these are essential for normal development. Inactivation of the
gene encoding DNA methyltransferase 3a (Dnmt3a) results in death a few
weeks after birth, whereas mice lacking Dnmt3b survive for only a few days
after birth. Hence, in mammals DNA methylation is essential for normal
development.
The idea that methylation differences might be essential for changing
chromatin structure is particularly attractive because of the ease with which
such differences can be propagated, allowing cellular commitment to be
stable over many generations (see Chapter 2, Section 2.1). In doublestranded DNA, the CG dinucleotide will exist as a symmetrical structure:
5′-CG-3′
3′-GC-5′
It has been observed that when one C in this structure is methylated,
the C on the opposite strand is also methylated. This effect is achieved
by the DNA methyltransferase enzyme Dnmt1. Unlike Dnmt3a and
Dnmt3b, which can carry out de novo methylation of unmethylated sites
(Figure 3.11a), Dnmt1 recognizes sites where only one C is methylated
(hemi-methylated sites) and rapidly methylates the second C residue
(Figure 3.11b).
This preference of Dnmt1 for hemi-methylated sites has been
explained by structural studies of the enzyme bound to unmethylated or
hemi-methylated DNA. When the enzyme is bound to an unmethylated
site, a cysteine-rich region interacts with the unmethylated C and this
results in a negatively acting autoregulatory domain lying across the catalytic domain of the enzyme and inhibiting its activity (Figure 3.12a). In
contrast, when the DNA is hemi-methylated, the cysteine-rich domain

does not interact with the methylated C and the autoregulatory domain is
displaced, leaving the catalytic domain free to methylate the C residue on
the complementary DNA strand (Figure 3.12b).
The pattern of DNA methylation will therefore be maintained following
DNA replication, with the hemi-methylated sites produced by replication
being rapidly remethylated (Figure 3.13). Similarly, because the maintenance methylase is only active on hemi-methylated sites, unmethylated
sites present in a particular tissue will be propagated through subsequent
cell divisions. Once established, a particular pattern of methylation will be
maintained, accounting for the stability of the committed state.
Such a mechanism also allows readily for the specific loss of methylation sites that must occur during the process of commitment to a particular
lineage. Such losses could occur via a specific active demethylation
event catalyzed by a demethylation enzyme (Figure 3.14a). Alternatively,
it could occur via passive demethylation, simply by inhibiting the action of
the maintenance methylase at a particular site following cell division
(Figure 3.14b), and it appears that both these mechanisms are used.
Initially, specific DNA demethylating enzymes proved difficult to identify
and attention therefore focused on the passive mechanism involving DNA
replication. This mechanism involving inhibition of a maintenance

Alteration of the methylation pattern to produce an unmethylated site can occur either by specific demethylation (a) or by inhibition of the
maintenance methylase and subsequent DNA replication (b).

ALTERATIONS IN DNA METHYLATION IN ACTIVE OR POTENTIALLY ACTIVE GENES
methylase would eventually result in the generation of cells at which the
site was fully methylated and cells in which it was unmethylated
(Figure 3.14b). This is exactly the pattern frequently observed in embryonic
development where a stem cell divides to yield one daughter that differentiates and another that maintains the stem cell lineage (Figure 3.15). As
with other methylation patterns, the new demethylated site in the committed cell would be propagated through subsequent cell divisions. Moreover,
this mechanism can explain the frequent requirement for cell division in
events involving changes in cellular differentiation that was discussed in
the introduction to this chapter.
More recently however, a family of enzymes with DNA demethylase
activity have been identified. These TET (ten eleven translocation) enzymes
are so named because the first member of the family (TET1) was identified
at the site of a translocation between chromosomes 10 and 11, which occurs
in cases of human leukemia. These enzymes oxidize 5-methylcytosine to
5-hydroxymethylcytosine (Figure 3.16). The prevalence of this conversion
event is indicated by the fact that 5-hydroxymethylcytosine can be present
in cellular DNA at up to 40% of the level of 5-methylcytosine.
Production of 5-hydroxymethylcytosine can result in the full demethylation of the DNA in at least two different ways. First, 5-hydroxymethylcytosine
can be further oxidized by TET enzymes to produce 5-formylcytosine and
then 5-carboxylcytosine (Figure 3.16). These modified bases are recognized
by DNA repair enzymes and are removed from the DNA and replaced with
an unmodified C residue (Figure 3.16).
Another mechanism by which production of 5-hydroxymethylcytosine
appears to produce full demethylation involves the DNA replication mechanism for passive demethylation discussed above. Thus, in discussing this
mechanism it was necessary to postulate a step in which the maintenance
methylase was inhibited at a specific site following cell division (Figure
3.14b). Interestingly, production of 5-hydroxymethylcytosine at this site
would have exactly this effect since it is not a substrate for maintenance
methylation by Dnmt1 (Figure 3.17 and compare with Figure 3.14b). This
second mechanism therefore combines active demethylation to produce
5-hydroxymethylcytosine with the passive DNA replication model.
DNA methylation processes therefore provide a means of explaining the
stability of the committed state, while allowing for its modification in suitable circumstances. Unlike DNA deletion events, methylation patterns are
reversible and could be altered when a cell undergoes transdifferentiation
or following nuclear transplantation (Chapter 1, Section 1.3). Hence, models of this type can explain the stable but not irreversible nature of the differentiated state and the frequent involvement of cell division in its
reprogramming.

DNA methylation recruits inhibitory proteins that produce a
tightly packed chromatin structure
The evidence suggesting an important role for DNA methylation in modulating the difference in chromatin structure between inactive and active
genes raises the question of how this is achieved. Clearly, undermethylation could promote the binding of proteins which produce a more open
chromatin structure (Figure 3.18a). Alternatively, an inhibitory protein
could bind to methylated DNA and promote a closed chromatin structure
(Figure 3.18b).
Although both these mechanisms may be used, current evidence supports the second mechanism. A number of different proteins able to bind
specifically to methyl-CpG have been characterized and shown to play critical roles in the regulation of gene expression. For example, a specific protein, MeCP2, has been shown to bind directly to methylated CG but not to
unmethylated CG and its binding results in the production of a tightly packed
closed chromatin structure and transcriptional repression.
The importance of MeCP2 and its recognition of methylated C residues
is demonstrated by the finding that humans with mutant forms of MeCP2
that are unable to recognize meCG, exhibit Rett syndrome. This is a severe
developmental disorder leading to mental retardation. Mice lacking another
methyl CG-binding protein, MBD1, also show defects in the nervous system,
indicating that several methyl CG-binding proteins are required for proper
development and functioning of the nervous system (see Chapter 11,

Section 11.4 and Chapter 12, Section 12.2 for discussion of human diseases
involving DNA methylation abnormalities).
Interestingly, binding of MeCP2 to meCG results in the recruitment of a
multiprotein complex which includes a histone deacetylase that can induce
the removal of acetyl groups from histones (Figure 3.19) (see Chapter 2,
Section 2.3). As deacetylation of histones is known to be associated with
transcriptionally inactive DNA (see Section 3.3), this illustrates the close link
between modification of DNA and modification of histones in determining
the structure of chromatin. This link is further strengthened by the observations that mice with a defective MeCP2 protein demonstrate enhanced
acetylation of histone H3.
Both MeCP2 and MBD1 also associate with histone methylase enzymes
resulting in enhanced methylation of histone H3, indicating that DNA methylation can regulate more than one histone modification. In agreement with
this, mouse cells lacking the maintenance methylase Dnmt1 exhibit alterations in histone acetylation and methylation as well as greatly reduced
methylation of the DNA itself. Therefore, DNA methylation may exert its
effects on chromatin structure, at least in part, by altering histone modification. The various histone modifications associated with changes in chromatin structure are discussed in the next section.

3.3 MODIFICATION OF HISTONeS IN THe CHROMATIN
OF ACTIVe OR POTeNTIALLY ACTIVe geNeS
As discussed in Chapter 2 (Section 2.3), histones are subject to a number of
different modifications, for example, acetylation, methylation, ubiquitination, and phosphorylation. All of these have been implicated in the regulation of chromatin structure and therefore of gene transcription. As with
DNA methylation (Section 3.2), the distribution of each of these histone
modifications across the entire genome can be studied by using the ChIP
assay (for detailed description of this assay see Chapter 4, Section 4.3).
Chromatin can be immunoprecipitated with an antibody to a specific histone modification (such as acetylation or methylation). DNA is then isolated
from the immunoprecipitate and analyzed by high-throughput DNA
sequencing so as to identify all the DNA fragments within the genome that
are associated with a particular modified histone within the chromatin
structure (Figure 3.20 and compare with Figure 3.7).
The role of each type of histone modification will be discussed in the
following sections and is summarized in Table 3.1.

(a) Acetylation
As described in Chapter 2 (Section 2.3), in the process of acetylation the free
amino group on specific lysine residues at the N-terminus of the histone
molecule is modified by one of the hydrogen atoms in the amino group
being substituted by an acetyl group (see Table 3.1). This reduces the net
positive charge on the histone molecule. Hyperacetylated forms of these
histones, containing several such acetyl groups, have been shown to be
localized preferentially in active genes exhibiting DNaseI sensitivity, while
hypoacetylation of the histones is characteristic of transcriptionally inactive
regions. Furthermore, treatment of cells with sodium butyrate, which inhibits a cellular deacetylase activity and hence increases histone acetylation,
has been shown to result in DNaseI sensitivity of some regions of chromatin
and to activate the expression of some previously silent cellular genes. As

with DNA methylation, there is therefore direct evidence that hyperacetylation of histones plays a role in opening the chromatin structure of active or
potentially active genes.
Further evidence in favor of a role for histone acetylation in the regulation of gene expression is the finding that several proteins that were characterized as being involved in the activation of transcription were subsequently
shown to have histone acetyltransferase (HAT) activity, being capable of
adding acetyl groups to histone molecules. For example, it has been shown
that both the CBP transcriptional co-activator (which plays a key role in the
activation of genes in response to cyclic AMP and other stimuli) and the
related p300 co-activator have histone acetyltransferase activity (see
Chapter 5, Section 5.2 for discussion of these co-activators). This directly
links this enzymatic activity with the ability to stimulate transcription.
Similarly, the TAFII250 subunit of the TFIID transcription factor which is critical for basal transcription of a wide range of genes (see Chapter 4, Section

Chromatin fragments containing a histone (H)

DNA sequencing. Compare with figure 3.7.

4.1), has been shown to have HAT activity, as has the ATF2 activator transcription factor.
In contrast, histone deacetylase (HDAC) activity has been observed to be
involved in the action of the nuclear receptor co-repressor, which mediates
the inhibitory effect of the thyroid hormone receptor on transcription when
thyroid hormone is absent. Thus, this factor has been shown to associate
with the Sin3/HDAC protein complex, which has the ability to deacetylate
histones. The inhibitory effect of the nuclear receptor co-repressor is therefore likely to involve the deacetylation of histones, thereby producing a
more tightly packed chromatin structure incompatible with transcription
(see Chapter 5, Section 5.3 for further discussion of transcriptional repression by the thyroid hormone receptor).
Thus, activating factors can direct the acetylation of histones, thereby
opening up the chromatin (Figure 3.21a), while inhibitory factors can
direct histone deacetylation thereby directing a more tightly packed chromatin structure (Figure 3.21b).
These findings therefore link the study of transcription factors (see
Chapter 5) with studies on chromatin structure. They suggest that the regulation of histone acetylation/deacetylation and thereby of chromatin structure by specific factors plays a key role in the regulation of gene expression.
As noted above (Section 3.2), the MeCP2 protein which binds specifically to
methyl CG dinucleotides can recruit a histone deacetylase activity, thereby
linking histone deacetylation to the repressive effect of DNA methylation.
In addition to activators recruiting acetylases and repressors recruiting
deacetylases, there is evidence that the acetylase/deacetylase enzymes

in myoblasts, the MEf2 transcriptional

of myotube-specific genes is repressed.
When differentiation is induced, the HDAC
is phosphorylated (Ph) and moves into the
cytoplasm, allowing MEf2 to activate the
transcription of myotube-specific genes.

can themselves be regulated. This is seen in muscle differentiation where
in myoblasts the transcriptional activator MEF2 is associated with histone deacetylases. When differentiation from myoblasts to mature
myotubes occurs the histone deacetylase is phosphorylated, which
induces it to move to the cytoplasm, thereby freeing MEF2 to activate transcription (Figure 3.22) (see Chapter 10, Section 10.1 for further discussion
of the role of MEF2 in muscle cell-specific gene expression).
As discussed in Chapter 2 (Section 2.3), the amino-terminal domains of
the histone proteins which are modified by acetylation, project beyond the
nucleosome core and could therefore potentially interact with the aminoterminal ends of histones in adjacent nucleosomes or with other nonhistone proteins. The effects of histone acetylation on chromatin structure
may therefore operate in one of two possible ways. First acetylation might
act by affecting the association of the histones with each other. A looser
association between the histones in adjacent nucleosomes could directly
result in improved access to the DNA for factors that can stimulate transcription (Figure 3.23a). Alternatively, such a looser association could

facilitate displacement of nucleosomes by chromatin remodeling complexes
(see Chapter 2, Section 2.2), so indirectly producing improved access for
activators (Figure 3.23b).
An alternative possibility is that these modifications affect the protein–
protein interaction of the histones with other regulatory molecules. This
would parallel the role proposed for DNA methylation differences in affecting the binding of positively or negatively acting factors to the DNA (see
Figure 3.18; Section 3.2). For example, acetylated histones might be
recognized by a positively acting molecule, leading to the destabilization
of the 30 nm fiber structure and transcriptional activation (Figure 3.24a).
Similarly, acetylation could disrupt an association with an inhibitory
molecule involved in maintaining the closed chromatin structure
(Figure 3.24b).
In agreement with this model of histone–regulatory protein interaction, it
has been shown that several activating factors such as Brg1 contain a region
known as the bromodomain that binds to histones with much greater
affinity when specific lysines in the histones are acetylated. Binding of
bromodomain-containing proteins to acetylated histones results in a more
open chromatin structure and transcriptional activation (Figure 3.25).

(b) Methylation
As well as being modified by acetylation, histones can also be modified by
methylation (see Chapter 2, Section 2.3). Unlike acetylation, methylation
can occur for both lysine and arginine amino acids in the histone molecule
and does not affect the negative charge on the histone molecule.
Although the acetylation of histones is associated with a more open
chromatin structure, the situation with methylation is more complex.
Methylation of specific arginine residues and of some lysine residues is associated with a more open chromatin structure and consequent transcriptional activation. In contrast however, methylation of other lysine residues
produces a more tightly packed chromatin structure and transcriptional
repression (see Table 3.1 and Figure 3.26).
The methylation of histone H4 on the arginine at position 3 promotes a
more open chromatin structure and facilitates transcriptional activation, for

example, by nuclear hormone receptors. A similar effect has also been
demonstrated for lysine 4 of histone H3 and ecdysone-dependent gene activation in Drosophila. Similarly, lysine 4 methylation of histone H3 was found to
be associated with transcriptionally active genes in the human genome and
with the transcriptionally active region of the mating type locus in yeast
(see Chapter 10, Section 10.3 for discussion of the yeast mating type system).
Interestingly, the adjacent transcriptionally inactive region of the yeast
mating type locus is associated with methylation of histone H3 on the lysine at
position 27, indicating that this modification is associated with transcriptional
repression (Table 3.1). Similarly, in the human genome, methylation of histone H3 on lysines 9 and 27 is associated with transcriptionally inactive genes.
It appears that the balance of methylation at different histone sites plays
a critical role in determining chromatin structure. For example, the polycomb complex which is involved in transcriptional repression contains a
histone methyltransferase enzyme that methylates histone H3 on lysines 9
and 27 (Figure 3.27). Conversely, the trithorax proteins act to open the
chromatin by promoting the methylation of histone H3 on lysine 4, which in
turn promotes demethylation at lysines 9 and 27 (Figure 3.28) (see Chapter
4, Section 4.4 for further discussion of transcriptional regulation by polycomb and trithorax proteins).
As with acetylation, methylation may act by affecting the interaction of
the histones with each other or their interaction with other positively or
negatively acting proteins. In agreement with this latter possibility, it has
been shown that methylation of histone H3 on lysine 9 allows it to be recognized by a protein known as HP1 which cannot recognize the unmethylated histone. HP1 is able to organize the chromatin into a very tightly
packed, inactive structure characteristic, for example, of heterochromatin
(see Chapter 2, Section 2.5).
As well as being recruited to chromatin where histones are methylated
on lysine 9, HP1 can also in turn recruit a histone methyltransferase
enzyme. This enzyme can catalyze the lysine 9 methylation of histone H3
in adjacent nucleosomes. Thus, the tightly packed heterochromatin structure produced by HP1 will spread along the DNA producing a large region
of tightly packed chromatin (Figure 3.29). This will continue until the
spreading structure encounters a sequence such as an insulator, which
prevents the spread of a particular chromatin structure to an adjacent
region (see Chapter 2, Section 2.5).
Interestingly, this effect can also explain how the methylation pattern of
histones can be propagated through cell division. When DNA with histone
H3 methylated on lysine 9 replicates, the nucleosomes will be randomly
divided between the daughter chromosomes (Figure 3.30). As each daughter chromosome will have only half the correct number of nucleosomes,
new nucleosomes will be assembled that will contain unmethylated histone

following DNA replication to produce two

pre-existing H3-containing nucleosomes
(dark blue) are randomly divided between
the two DNA molecules. New nucleosomes
(light blue) then assemble on the DNA
and these contain unmethylated histone
H3. Recruitment of HP1 and histone
methyltransferase (HMT) to the original
methylated histones produces methylation
of the histone H3 in the adjacent newly
assembled nucleosomes. This insures
that the pre-existing pattern of histone
methylation is inherited when cells replicate.

86

Chapter 3: The Epigenome: Role of Chromatin Structure in Gene Control

H3. However, the original nucleosomes containing histone H3 methylated
on lysine 9 will recruit HP1 and its associated histone methyltransferase,
allowing histones in adjacent nucleosomes to be methylated (Figure 3.30).
A similar mechanism for propagating the inhibitory methylation of histone H3 on lysine 27 along the chromosome and following cell division
involves the PRC2 polycomb complex. Thus, this complex binds to histone
H3 which is trimethylated on lysine 27. This binding actually activates a
histone methyltransferase enzyme within the PRC2 complex. As this enzyme
can itself methylate histone H3 on lysine 27, this will result in the propagation of this inhibitory signal along the chromosome and to daughter chromosomes, paralleling the role of HP1 in propagating the methylation of
lysine 9 of histone H3.
These mechanisms therefore allow the pattern of histone H3 methylation
to be stably inherited, paralleling the mechanisms that exist to allow the
transmission of DNA methylation patterns through cell division (see Section
3.2). However, as with DNA methylation patterns, such patterns can also be
altered. In the case of histone methylation, this can be achieved either by
active demethylation by specific enzymes or by inhibiting the methylation of
newly assembled nucleosomes, which normally occurs during cell division.
Clearly, a key feature of HP1 is its ability to recognize histone H3 which
is methylated on lysine 9. HP1 binds to the methylated histone via a domain
known as the chromodomain, which is found in many proteins that inhibit
transcription. Recognition of histones methylated on lysine 9 by chromodomain-containing proteins is therefore a key event in organizing the tightly
packed structure of inactive chromatin (Figure 3.31).
The recognition of lysine 9 methylated histones by chromodomaincontaining proteins contrasts with the role of acetylation in promoting recognition of the histones by proteins containing a bromodomain, described
above. Chromodomain-containing proteins therefore recognize histones
methylated on specific residues and promote the tight packing of chromatin,
while the recognition of acetylated histones by bromodomain-containing
proteins promotes the more open chromatin structure characteristic of
active or potentially active DNA (Figure 3.31).
Interestingly, the nucleosome remodeling factor (NURF), which can
affect nucleosome positioning and thereby alter chromatin structure (see
Chapter 2, Section 2.2), uses a different domain known as the PHD finger to
recognize methylated histones. Using this domain, NURF recognizes the
activating methylation on lysine 4 of histone H3. It then remodels the chromatin to produce a more open chromatin structure, allowing transcription
to occur (Figure 3.32).
Methylations of histones at different positions can therefore recruit different proteins which bind to the histones via specific protein domains. In
turn, these proteins promote either a more tightly packed or a more open
chromatin structure.

(c)

Ubiquitination and SUMOylation

As noted in Chapter 2 (Section 2.3), addition of the small protein ubiquitin
to histones only occurs for histones H2A and H2B. Only a small amount of
the H2A in a cell (about 5–10%) exists in this form and such ubiquitination
is associated with the repression of gene expression. It has been shown
that ubiquitination of histone H2A is catalyzed by a component of the polycomb protein complex, which as described above promotes an inactive
chromatin structure and transcriptional repression (see also Section 3.6 for
further discussion of the role of the polycomb complex in X-chromosome
inactivation).
Ubiquitination of H2B has the opposite effect to the ubiquitination of
H2A since it stimulates rather than inhibits gene expression (Figure 3.33).
This is because, as discussed in Chapter 2 (Section 2.3), ubiquitination of
H2B promotes the methylation of histone H3 on lysines at positions 4 and
79. Interestingly, it appears that H2B plays a particularly important role in
stimulating the transition of lysines 4 and 79 from a monomethylated state,
with one methyl group to the trimethylated state where each lysine has

three methyl groups (see Chapter 2, Section 2.3, for discussion of mono-,
di-, and tri-methylation). As methylation on lysines 4 and 79 promotes an
open chromatin structure (see above), this provides an explanation for the
stimulatory effect of H2B ubiquitination on gene expression. Moreover, it
indicates that modification of one type of histone can modulate the modification of another type of histone molecule.
In addition to their overall opposing effects on chromatin structure and
gene expression, ubiquitinated H2A and ubiquitinated H2B also specifically oppose one other in respectively inhibiting or promoting the recruitment of the FACT protein, which plays a key role in the elongation of the
initial RNA transcript (for further discussion of transcriptional elongation,
see Chapter 4, Section 4.2). Ubiquitinated H2A blocks recruitment of FACT,
thereby inhibiting transcriptional elongation, whereas ubiquitinated H2B
promotes such recruitment, thereby stimulating transcriptional elongation
(Figure 3.34).
As discussed in Chapter 2 (Section 2.3) lysine residues on histones can
also be modified by addition of SUMO (small ubiquitin-related modifier)
which, as its name suggests, is a small protein related to ubiquitin. This
modification is associated with transcriptional repression due to the recruitment of enzymes which deacetylate histones, thereby resulting in a more
closed chromatin structure.

(d) Phosphorylation
Unlike acetylation, methylation or ubiquitination-sumoylation, phosphorylation targets serine or threonine amino acids in the histone molecule. Such
histone phosphorylation is associated with a more open chromatin structure allowing transcription to occur. For example, it has been shown that
when cells are exposed to heat shock (elevated temperature), phosphorylated histone H3 is concentrated at the heat-shock gene loci which are being
actively transcribed and is depleted from other loci which are silenced following heat shock.
Similarly, when cells are stimulated to undergo cell division by treatment
with growth factors, histone H3 is phosphorylated on the serine residue at
position 10 in the amino-terminus of the protein. These phosphorylated histones are localized to genes which become transcriptionally active following
growth factor stimulation, such as the c-fos and c-myc genes (Figure 3.35)

FIgURe 3.35
following growth factor stimulation, histone
H3 becomes phosphorylated within the
nucleosomes bound to the c-myc and c-fos
genes. This is associated with their moving
from an inactive closed chromatin structure
(wavy line) to a more open structure (solid
line), allowing transcription to occur in
response to the growth factor.

88

Chapter 3: The Epigenome: Role of Chromatin Structure in Gene Control

(see Chapter 11, Sections 11.1 and 11.2, for further discussion of these genes
and their role in cell growth/division).
Such growth factor-induced phosphorylation of histone H3 does not
occur in human patients with Coffin-Lowry syndrome who lack the phosphorylation enzyme known as Rsk-2, which is responsible for phosphorylating histone H3 following growth factor stimulation. These patients suffer
from a number of developmental defects including mental retardation, as
well as facial and other abnormalities. Moreover, they show a lack of gene
activation in response to growth factor stimulation, indicating the importance of Rsk-2-mediated phosphorylation of histone H3 in this process.
In addition to the core histones, phosphorylation also occurs on histone
H1. Interestingly, this phosphorylation reduces its ability to interact with the
HP1 protein mentioned above. As HP1 is important in producing the very
tightly packed structure of heterochromatin, phosphorylation of H1 may be
a key event in moving from a very tightly packed chromatin structure to a
more open one (Figure 3.36).

structure (d).

FUNCTIONAL INTERACTION OF DIFFERENT HISTONE MODIFICATIONS, DNA METHYLATION
(e)

89

Other histone modifications

As discussed in Chapter 2 (Section 2.3), histones can also be modified by
addition of a sugar molecule O-linked N-acetylglucosamine (O-GlcNac). As
with phosphorylation, this glycosylation process targets serine residues
within the histone and both serine 10 of histone H3 and serine 112 of histone H2B have been shown to be modified in this manner.
The effect of O-GlcNAc modification has been best characterized in the
case of serine 112 of histone H2B, where it sets off a cascade of modification
resulting in a more open chromatin structure (see Table 3.1). Thus, as noted
in Chapter 2 (Section 2.3) this modification of histone H2B facilitates ubiquitination of lysine 120 in H2B itself and in turn, as noted above, this promotes methylation of histone H3 on lysines 4 and 79 (Table 3.1).
Most interestingly, a functional link also exists between O-GlcNAc
modification of histone H2B and the demethylation of methylcytosine in
DNA by TET enzymes which was described above (Section 3.2). It has been
shown that the O-GlcNAc transferase (OGT) enzyme which glycosylates
histone H2B is recruited to the DNA by the TET2 enzyme bound to
5-hydroxymethylcytosine (Figure 3.37). Hence, 5-hydroxymethylcytosine
may not simply be an intermediate in the demethylation of cytosine by TET
enzymes but may actually serve as a signal for the recruitment of the OGT
enzyme leading to the production of a more open chromatin structure.
As well as the various modifications of the core histones discussed
in this section, histone H1 has been shown to be regulated by a novel
modification citrullination, as well as by phosphorylation (see above).
Citrullination involves the modification of an arginine amino acid within
the protein to produce the amino acid citrulline, which is not coded for by
the genetic code, described in Chapter 6 (Section 6.6). Such citrullination of histone H1 has been shown to be essential for its role in chromatin
compaction (see Chapter 2, Section 2.4).

FUNCTIONAL INTeRACTION OF DIFFeReNT
HISTONe MODIFICATIONS, DNA MeTHYLATION,
AND RegULATORY RNAs

The different histone modifications functionally interact with
one another
As discussed in Section 3.3, modifications of the histones can have either
stimulatory or inhibitory effects on gene expression by altering chromatin
structure. Table 3.1 summarizes the different modifications of the various
histones. The modifications at the N-terminal of histone H3 are illustrated in
Figure 3.38.
Throughout our discussion of these modifications both in Chapter 2
(Section 2.3) and in this chapter (Section 3.3) we have seen examples where
different histone modifications interact with one another functionally. At the
simplest level, this can involve the fact that some lysine residues (such as
residues 9 and 27 in histone H3) can be modified by either acetylation or
methylation. As these modifications target the same chemical group, they
are mutually exclusive. Moreover, acetylation at these positions promotes
an open chromatin structure whereas methylation at the same positions
promotes a closed chromatin structure (Figure 3.39a).
At a more complex level, modification at one residue can promote or
inhibit modifications at adjacent residues. As discussed in Chapter 2 (Section
2.3), phosphorylation of serine 10 in histone H3 is associated with acetylation

of lysines 9 and 14 as well as demethylation of lysine 9. In this region of
histone H3, acetylation and phosphorylation are characteristic of open chromatin whereas in closed chromatin the histone H3 is not acetylated or phosphorylated but is methylated on lysine 9 (Figure 3.39b). Hence, different
modifications on the same histone can functionally interact to produce different patterns of modification, characteristic of active or inactive chromatin.
At a still more complex level, the modification of one histone can affect
the modification of another histone. An example of this was discussed in
Section 3.3, with glycosylation of histone H2B stimulating ubiquitination of
this histone, which in turn promotes methylation of a lysine in histone H3.
Similarly, methylation of histone H4 on the arginine at position 3 stimulates
acetylation of histone H3 and its demethylation at lysines 9 and 27, producing the modification pattern characteristic of open chromatin (Figure 3.39c).
These various interactions result in particular patterns of modified histones. In turn, this has led to the idea of a “histone code” in which regulatory
proteins are recruited to the DNA by recognizing a pattern of histone modifications rather than a single modification at a single site. This could involve
a single protein recognizing multiple different modifications (Figure 3.40a).
Alternatively, it could involve multiple proteins, each of which recognizes
an individual modification, with a code reader protein then recognizing the
pattern of multiple bound proteins (Figure 3.40b). In either case, the endpoint would be the local modification of chromatin structure to produce
either the open beads-on-a-string structure, the more tightly packed structure of the 30 nm fiber, or the even closer packing characteristic of
heterochromatin.

Histone modifications interact with DNA methylation
to regulate chromatin structure
As discussed in Section 3.2, DNA methylation plays an important role in
regulating chromatin structure, paralleling the role of histone modifications
discussed in Section 3.3. It is now possible to map the pattern of DNA methylation and histone modifications across the entire genome (see Figures 3.6,
3.7, and 3.20). Evidently, the maps obtained in this way can be compared by
appropriate computational techniques and the relationship of DNA methylation and histone modification determined for the entire genome of a specific cell type or under specific conditions (Figure 3.41a).
As well as determining the DNA methylation and histone modification
patterns independently and then comparing them, it is also possible to
determine directly the methylation pattern of DNA fragments associated
with a particular histone modification. In this case, the ChIP assay is used to
immunoprecipitate DNA associated with a specific modified histone (as in
Figure 3.20) and then the methylation pattern of this DNA is then determined by sodium bisulfite treatment (as in Figure 3.6). This sequential

produce a more open chromatin structure.

analysis of histone modification and DNA methylation thus allows their relationship to be directly determined (Figure 3.41b).
As with the different histone modifications, there is clear evidence of
an interaction between histone modifications and DNA methylation. As
discussed above (Section 3.3), the HP1 protein binds to histone H3 methylated on lysine 9 and plays a critical role in organizing the very tightly packed
chromatin structure characteristic of heterochromatin (see Section 3.3).
HP1 has been shown to recruit the DNA methyltransferases, Dnmt1, Dnmt3a,
and Dnmt3b, so linking the inhibitory effects of H3 lysine 9 methylation and
DNA methylation (Figure 3.42). A similar interaction with DNA methyltransferases has also been reported for the polycomb complex, which can
methylate lysines 9 and 27 of histone H3.
Interestingly, an interaction has been demonstrated between DNA methylation and one of the variant isoforms of the histones, discussed in Chapter
2 (Section 2.3). Thus, the histone variant H2AZ, which is enriched in active
genes, is able to protect such genes from DNA methylation while conversely
DNA methylation prevents H2AZ recruitment.
Hence, specific histone modifications not only influence the modification
of other sites in the same or different histones but together with variant
histone isoforms can also influence methylation of the DNA.

As discussed in Chapter 1 (Section 1.5) it is now clear that regulatory RNA

RNAs. Each of these groups will be discussed in turn.

Long noncoding RNAs

In recent years, it has become clear that long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) play
a key role in the regulation of gene expression. In different situations, such
lncRNAs can have either a stimulatory or inhibitory effect on gene expression, acting via a variety of different mechanisms (see Chapter 1, Section 1.5).
One mechanism by which such RNAs act is via inducing an alteration in
chromatin structure of their target genes. In many cases, it has now been
shown that the same genomic region containing protein-coding genes can
also specify noncoding antisense regulatory RNAs that are transcribed from
the opposite strand of the DNA from that which is transcribed to produce
the sense protein-coding RNA (Figure 3.43a). Such antisense transcripts
can originate within the gene itself or can initiate within the flanking DNA
and extend into the gene itself.
In turn, such antisense transcripts have been shown in different cases to
recruit a wide variety of chromatin-modifying enzyme complexes to the
locus from which they are transcribed. These include the PRC2 polycomb
complex which will produce an inhibitory pattern of histone methylation
(Figure 3.43b) (see Section 3.3) and the Dnmt1 or Dnmt3 m/3b methyltransferases enzymes which will respectively maintain (Figure 3.43c) or

A long noncoding RNA (lncRNA) can be transcribed from the opposite DNA

recruit protein complexes such as the PRC2 polycomb complex which
methylates histones (H) (b) or the DNA methyltransferases Dnmt1 (c) and
Dnmt3 (d). in turn, such complexes produce a tightly packed chromatin
structure incompatible with transcription of the protein-coding RNA (e).

produce (Figure 3.43d) methylation of the DNA (see Section 3.2). All these
modifications will produce a tightly packed chromatin structure preventing
the transcription of the protein-coding RNA and thereby inhibiting gene
expression (Figure 3.43e).
As well as acting in a negative manner to inhibit gene expression, lncRNAs
can also stimulate gene expression. This is seen in the case of the gene encoding the CEBPA protein. As well as being transcribed to produce a 2.5 kilobase
protein-coding transcript, the sense strand of this gene is also transcribed to
produce a larger 4.5 kilobase transcript whose expression pattern parallels
that of the protein-coding transcript (Figure 3.44). It has been shown that this
regulatory RNA acts by binding the Dnmt1 DNA methyltransferase enzyme.
However, rather than recruiting this protein to the target gene, as in the example discussed above, it sequesters Dnmt1 away from the CEBPA gene and
prevents it methylating the gene, thereby maintaining an open chromatin
structure and having a positive effect on CEBPA gene expression.

The same DNA strand of the CEBPA gene is transcribed

and so maintains an open chromatin structure compatible

Hence, lncRNAs can be transcribed from the sense or antisense strand of
their target genes and can have positive or negative effects on gene expression via the regulation of chromatin structure.

(b) Small RNAs
As discussed in Chapter 1 (Section 1.5), small regulatory RNAs have predominantly inhibitory effects on gene expression. Although such small
RNAs mainly act at post-transcriptional levels, inducing degradation of their
target mRNA or blocking its translation (see Chapter 7, Section 7.7), the
small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) can also repress gene expression at the
level of transcription by directing the formation of a tightly packed chromatin structure.
These siRNAs are produced by cleavage of larger double-stranded RNA
precursors by the Dicer protein (see Chapter 1, Section 1.5). In cases where
the siRNAs repress gene expression post-transcriptionally, they bind a
complex known as RISC (RNA-induced silencing complex) which contains a number of proteins including a member of the Argonaute protein
family. The complex of RISC and the siRNA then binds to its target mRNA
(Figure 3.45a) (see Chapter 7, Section 7.7). In contrast, where the siRNA
represses gene expression via the regulation of chromatin structure it
binds a different complex which also contains an Argonaute protein and is
known as the RITS (RNA-induced transcriptional silencing) complex. The
siRNA and RITS complex then bind to target genes, resulting in their transcriptional repression (Figure 3.45b). The ability of siRNAs to repress
gene expression at the transcriptional level was first described in plants,
where it appears to be particularly widespread. However, it has also been
described in a range of organisms from yeast to mammals.
In particular, siRNAs play a key role in the formation of the very tightly
packed chromatin structure of heterochromatin (see Chapter 2, Section 2.5).
The siRNA molecules can bind to complementary sequences in the target
gene (Figure 3.46a) and then recruit the HP1 protein (Figure 3.46b). As
described above, HP1 plays a key role in the formation of heterochromatin.

single-stranded siRNAs then bind to their
target mRNA and induce its degradation (a).
Alternatively, they can bind the RNA-induced

which also contains an Argonaute protein.
They then bind to target genes and direct
the formation of a tightly packed chromatin
structure (b).

Transcriptional

It has the ability to produce inhibitory methylation of histones (Section 3.3)
and to recruit DNA methyltransferases which methylate the DNA on C residues (Section 3.2).
The binding of siRNA therefore results in the methylation of histones at
inhibitory sites, for example on lysine 9 of histone H3 and the methylation of
DNA on C residues, thereby promoting the tightly packed structure of heterochromatin (Figure 3.46c). As noted above (Section 3.3), methylation of
histone H3 on lysine 9 promotes further binding of HP1, which can also
catalyze further histone methylation, forming a positive feedback loop. Hence,
a complex interplay of siRNA, histone methylation, and DNA methylation
exists which establishes and maintains the tightly packed structure of heterochromatin, as well as propagating it along the chromosome (Figure 3.46d).
Clearly, the siRNA can achieve its effect on chromatin structure by binding to the DNA of its target gene and then recruiting histone methyltransferases and DNA methyltransferases, as shown in Figure 3.46 (Figure 3.47a).
However, it is also possible for the small siRNA to bind to the gene by complementary base pairing to a nascent RNA which is being transcribed from
the target gene (Figure 3.47b). As before, this will result in recruitment of
histone methyltransferases and DNA methyltransferases to the DNA, leading
to a more tightly packed chromatin structure.
The model of siRNA binding to an RNA rather than a DNA target is supported by the finding that many genes targeted by siRNAs also produce
longer antisense transcripts derived from the opposite strand of the DNA to
that which produces the protein-coding mRNA. Such transcripts can then
act as a target for siRNA binding (Figure 3.47b). This example therefore
combines the actions of siRNAs and lncRNAs, with RNA–RNA binding acting
as the signal to recruit protein complexes that produce a tightly packed
chromatin structure.
Although this mechanism of siRNA binding to an RNA target and recruiting enzymes which alter chromatin structure appears to occur in all eukaryotes, it has been particularly well characterized in plants, such as
Arabidopsis. Interestingly, in this case the siRNAs are transcribed by a

in the DNA (c). in turn, methylation of histones promotes further recruitment
of HP1 (d). This ensures the stability of the tightly packed chromatin
structure once it is created and its propagation down the chromosome.

plant-specific RNA polymerase enzyme, known as RNA polymerase IV (also
known as IVa), which is not found in animals. Similarly, the longer RNA targets for siRNA have been shown to be transcribed by another plant-specific
RNA polymerase, which is known as RNA polymerase V (also known as IVb).
These polymerases have some subunits in common with RNA polymerase II
and others which are specific to RNA polymerase IV and/or RNA polymerase
V (see Chapter 4, Section 4.1 for discussion of RNA polymerases).
Interestingly, the piRNAs, a class of small RNAs distinct from the siRNAs
(see Chapter 1, Section 1.5) are found only in animals. Like the siRNAs,
piRNAs can bind to their targets either at the DNA level or via a nascent RNA
transcript. As for siRNAs, such binding results in the recruitment of HP1 and
the production of a tightly packed chromatin structure via methylation of
histone H3 on lysine 9. Hence, two different classes of small RNAs can produce transcriptional inhibition via a closed chromatin structure, with different organisms using one or both of these classes for this purpose.

DNaseI hypersensitive sites can be identified in active
or potentially active genes
So far in this chapter we have seen that regions of chromatin containing
active or potentially active genes have a number of distinguishing features,
including undermethylation of C residues, histone modifications, and
increased sensitivity to digestion with DNaseI. Such changes can extend
over the entire region of the gene and some flanking sequences and in the
case of DNaseI sensitivity result in an approximately 10-fold increase in the
rate at which active or potentially active genes are digested.
Following the discovery of increased DNaseI sensitivity, many investigators studied whether within the region of increased sensitivity there might be
particular sites that were even more sensitive to cutting with the enzyme and
that would therefore be cut even before the bulk of active DNA was digested.
The technique used to look for such DNaseI hypersensitive sites is based
on that used to look at the overall DNaseI sensitivity of a particular region of
DNA (which was described in Methods Box 3.1). Chromatin is digested with
DNaseI and a restriction enzyme and then subjected to a Southern blotting
procedure using a probe derived from the gene of interest. As we have seen
previously, the overall sensitivity of the gene can be monitored by observing
how rapidly the specific restriction enzyme fragment derived from the gene
disappears with increasing amounts of the enzyme (see Figure 3.3).
To search for DNaseI hypersensitive sites however, much lower concentrations of the enzyme are used and the appearance of discrete
digested fragments derived from the gene is monitored (Figure 3.48; see
Methods Box 3.2 and compare with Methods Box 3.1). Such specific
fragments have at one end the cutting site for the restriction enzyme used
and at the other, a site at which DNaseI has cut producing a defined fragment. Since the position at which the restriction enzyme cuts in the gene
is known, the position of the hypersensitive site can be mapped simply by
determining the size of the fragment produced.
Using this procedure a very wide variety of genes were shown to contain
such hypersensitive sites, exhibiting a sensitivity to DNaseI digestion 10-fold
above that of the remainder of an active gene and therefore about 100-fold
above that seen in inactive DNA. Although initially DNaseI hypersensitive
sites were mapped within individual genes in this manner, it is now possible
to map such sites across the entire genome and then to compare their distribution in different cell types and under different conditions. This is
achieved simply by using high-throughput sequencing to analyze all the
fragments generated by cleavage at DNaseI hypersensitive sites, so locating
all such sites within the known genomic DNA sequence of the organism
being studied.

Studies of DNaseI hypersensitive sites either individually or across the
genome have shown that, as with the increased sensitivity of an individual
gene itself, many hypersensitive sites appear only in tissues where the gene
in which they are located is active. For example, the increased sensitivity of
globin DNA in erythrocytes to digestion is paralleled by the presence of
hypersensitive sites within the gene in erythrocyte chromatin but not in that
of other tissues. Similarly, the ovalbumin gene in hormonally treated chick
oviduct also exhibits hypersensitive sites that are not found in other tissues,
including erythrocytes (Figure 3.49).
Similar to the pattern of DNA hypomethylation and the sensitivity of the
entire gene to digestion, DNaseI hypersensitive sites appear to be related to
the potential for gene expression rather than always being associated with
the act of transcription itself. For example, the hypersensitive sites near the
Drosophila heat-shock genes are present in the chromatin of embryonic cells

As with DNA methylation and generally increased sensitivity to DNaseI, the
appearance of hypersensitive sites therefore appears to be involved in gene
regulation. This idea is reinforced by the location of the hypersensitive sites,
which can be precisely mapped as described above. Thus, the ENCODE project studying the human genome mapped the location of DNaseI hypersensitive sites across the entire genome in 125 different human cell and tissue
types. These studies identified 2.9 million DNaseI hypersensitive sites which
mapped to virtually all known DNA regulatory sequences, both those located
in the promoter region at the 5′ end of individual genes and in more distant
regulatory regions such as enhancers (see Chapter 4, Sections 4.3 and 4.4
for discussion of these regulatory sequences). Hence, DNaseI hypersensitive
sites both appear before the onset of transcription and are located at DNA
sequences known to regulate transcription itself.
Interestingly, hypersensitive sites show a highly significant spatial and
temporal pattern in the cluster of β-globin genes, which was described in
Chapter 2 (Section 2.5). Very early in erythroid development, before the
expression of the β-globin genes, multiple DNaseI hypersensitive sites
appear in the locus control region (LCR) (Figure 3.50). This is consistent
with the role of the LCR in directing the opening up of a large region of DNA,
allowing the subsequent activation of individual genes in the cluster. Indeed,
the ε-globin, γ-globin, and β-globin genes are subsequently expressed
successively in embryonic, fetal, and adult erythroid cells. In each case,

98

Chapter 3: The Epigenome: Role of Chromatin Structure in Gene Control

expression is preceded by the appearance of DNaseI hypersensitive sites in
the regulatory region upstream of the individual gene (Figure 3.50).
As noted in Chapter 2 (Section 2.5) the looping pattern of the β-globin
cluster changes during erythroid development so that at each stage, the
gene(s) being expressed at that stage are closely associated with the LCR to
form an active chromatin hub. This involves an association of the LCR
region containing multiple hypersensitive sites with the regulatory region of
the active gene(s) that contains the gene-specific hypersensitive site. This
further supports the key role of hypersensitive sites in producing a chromatin structure that allows transcription of the appropriate gene(s) to occur.
In the case of the Drosophila gene encoding the glue protein Sgs4, the
fortuitous existence of a mutant strain of fly has indicated the functional
importance of hypersensitive sites. In normal flies this gene contains two
hypersensitive sites, 405 and 480 bases upstream of the start of transcription.
In the mutant, both sites are removed by a small DNA deletion of 100 base
pairs. Despite the fact that this gene still has the start site of transcription and
350 bases of upstream sequences, no transcription occurs (Figure 3.51),
indicating the regulatory importance of the region containing the hypersensitive sites.

DNaseI hypersensitive sites represent areas which are either
nucleosome-free or have an altered nucleosomal structure
It is clear therefore that hypersensitive sites represent another marker for
active or potentially active chromatin and are a feature likely to be of particular importance in gene regulation, being associated with many DNA
sequences that regulate gene expression. It is therefore necessary to consider the nature and significance of these sites.
In some cases, DNAseI hypersensitive sites are likely to be formed where
DNA is entirely free of nucleosomes and is therefore highly sensitive to
DNaseI digestion. This is seen for example, in the case of the DNaseI hypersensitive sites within the enhancer element that regulates transcription of
the eukaryotic virus SV40. When this virus enters cells its DNA, which is
circular and only 5000 bases in size, becomes associated with histones in a
typical nucleosomal structure that can be visualized in the electron microscope as a mini-chromosome. When this is done however, the region containing the hypersensitive sites remains nucleosome-free and is seen as
naked DNA (Figure 3.52). A similar lack of nucleosomes in the region of
hypersensitive sites is also found in the chicken β-globin gene, the 5′ hypersensitive site of this gene being excisable as a 115 bp restriction fragment
lacking any associated nucleosome.
Although such cases indicate that hypersensitive sites can be produced
by the complete loss of nucleosomes in a particular region, other cases exist
where such sites are produced by an alteration in the structure of a nucleosome rather than its complete displacement (Figure 3.53). It is clear however, that whether caused by nucleosome displacement or structural alterations, the changes occurring in hypersensitive sites facilitate the entry of
transcription factors or the RNA polymerase itself and allow the initiation of

transcription (Figure 3.53). In view of the critical role played by the changes
in nucleosomes that occur at hypersensitive sites, it is necessary therefore
to consider the manner in which such alterations in nucleosome positioning
or structure are produced.

Chromatin remodeling can be produced by proteins capable of
displacing nucleosomes or altering their structure
As discussed in Chapter 2 (Section 2.2), protein factors have been identified
that can induce the displacement of nucleosomes or alter their structure,
thereby facilitating the subsequent binding of transcription factors which
stimulate transcription. In the case of the heat-shock genes whose transcription is induced by elevated temperature, hypersensitive sites are produced by the binding of the GAGA protein factor to its upstream DNA
binding sites in the gene promoter, which results in the displacement of a
nucleosome (Figure 3.54). This binding of the GAGA factor occurs in
cells before heat treatment and hence hypersensitive sites are present before
heat treatment. Following heat treatment, a transcription factor known as
the heat-shock factor (HSF) binds to this region of DNA and transcription
is stimulated. In this case, HSF is only capable of binding following heat
shock and stimulation of transcription therefore only occurs following such
treatment (Figure 3.55a) (see Chapter 4, Section 4.3 and Chapter 8, Section
8.1 for further discussion of HSF and its mechanism of action).
In other cases however, where the necessary transcription factors are
present in all tissues, transcription may follow immediately after the nucleosome-free region is generated allowing these factors access. In the case of
glucocorticoid-responsive genes, the critical regulatory event is the binding
of the glucocorticoid receptor/steroid complex to a particular DNA sequence
(the GRE or glucocorticoid response element), which results in the displacement of a nucleosome or alters its structure and generates a DNaseI
hypersensitive site. Ubiquitous transcription factors present in all tissues,
such as NFI and the TATA box binding factor TBP (see Chapter 4, Section
4.1), immediately bind to this region and transcription begins (Figure 3.55b)
(for further details of the glucocorticoid receptor and its mode of action see
Chapter 5, Section 5.1 and Chapter 8, Section 8.1).
Although these two situations appear different in terms of the time at
which the hypersensitive site appears relative to the onset of transcription,
they illustrate the basic role of hypersensitive sites, namely the displacement of nucleosomes or alteration of their structure and the generation of a
site of access for regulatory proteins.

The SWI/SNF and NURF chromatin remodeling complexes are
recruited to the DNA by a variety of different mechanisms

complex known as the SWI/SNF complex which, as described in Chapter 2
(Section 2.2), is able to hydrolyze ATP and use this energy to alter nucleosomal
structure, so facilitating the subsequent binding of activator molecules.
The role of the SWI/SNF complex is not confined to steroid-responsive
genes and it appears that it can be recruited to a wide variety of different
genes by regulatory proteins that bind to these genes. The SWI/SNF complex
then acts to alter the chromatin structure of these genes, thereby facilitating
their subsequent activation by other transcription factors (Figure 3.56). In
agreement with this idea, the brahma mutation in Drosophila inactivates the
SWI2 component of the complex, which produces the ATP hydrolyzing
activity. This results in a failure to activate the homeotic genes which play a
key role in determining body pattern and produces a mutant fly with an
abnormal body pattern (see Chapter 5, Section 5.1 and Chapter 9, Section
9.2 for discussion of homeotic genes and their regulation).
The SWI/SNF complex is therefore involved in altering the chromatin
structure and thereby facilitating the transcriptional activation of genes as

structure as illustrated in figure 3.53.

CHANGES IN CHROMATIN STRUCTURE IN THE REGULATORY REGIONS
diverse as steroid-responsive genes and homeotic genes. Moreover, once
nucleosome disruption has been produced by SWI/SNF it can dissociate
from the gene, since the alteration in nucleosome structure and DNaseI
hypersensitive site produced by SWI/SNF persists even after it has
dissociated.
The activity of the SWI/SNF complex has been shown to be modified by
interaction with the linker histone H1. In the absence of histone H1, SWI/
SNF promotes the displacement of nucleosomes to the end of the DNA molecule, whereas in the presence of histone H1 SWI/SNF promotes controlled
nucleosome displacement. Hence, in addition to its role in the 30 nm fiber
structure of chromatin (see Chapter 2, Section 2.4), histone H1 also regulates the displacement of nucleosomes to the correct position on the DNA
(Figure 3.57).
As with SWI/SNF, the GAGA factor described above also plays a general role in chromatin remodeling and does not act solely on the heatshock genes. Inactivation of the gene encoding the GAGA factor in
Drosophila results in a mutant fly with an altered body pattern known as
trithorax, which is similar to the brahma mutation in that a wide range of
homeotic genes are not activated. Moreover, the GAGA/trithorax factor
is also associated with another multiprotein complex, known as
nucleosome remodeling factor (NURF) which resembles the SWI/SNF factor in its ability to hydrolyze ATP and alter nucleosome structure (see
Section 3.3 and Chapter 4, Section 4.4 for further discussion of trithorax
proteins).
The alteration of chromatin structure at regulatory regions is therefore
brought about by multiprotein complexes such as SWI/SNF or NURF which
are active on a wide range of genes. These complexes are likely to be
recruited to specific gene promoters by interaction with DNA-binding proteins such as the glucocorticoid receptor or GAGA which have already
bound to the DNA in a gene-specific manner. In turn this binding facilitates
the subsequent binding of other activating molecules by altering nucleosome positioning or structure in an ATP-dependent manner.
The SWI/SNF complex has also been shown to be associated with the
RNA polymerase II holoenzyme which, as discussed in Chapter 4 (Section
4.1), is a complex of RNA polymerase II with basal transcription factors
such as TFIIB, TFIIF, and TFIIH. Moreover, it has been shown that the recruitment of the RNA polymerase II complex containing SWI/SNF factors can
result in the opening up of chromatin, indicating that the SWI/SNF complex
can also function when brought to the DNA in this way. In agreement with
this, the TATA box which binds TFIID and hence recruits the RNA polymerase II complex has been shown to be of critical importance for recruiting the
complexes which remodel the chromatin containing the globin gene
promoter.
Multiple mechanisms may therefore act to recruit the SWI/SNF and
NURF complexes to a particular gene. Whatever the manner in which they
are recruited however, it is clear that these ATP-dependent chromatin
remodeling complexes play a key role in opening up the regulatory regions
of specific genes so that trans-acting transcription factors can bind and

regulate their expression. Moreover, such remodeling processes relate
closely to the histone modifications discussed in Section 3.3. For example,
it has been shown that acetylation of histones facilitates recruitment of
SWI/SNF to the β-interferon promoter and such histone modification also
prevents SWI/SNF dissociating once it has bound. Similarly, as discussed in
Section 3.3, NURF can be recruited to the DNA by recognizing histones
methylated at positions associated with an opening of the chromatin structure. Histone modification and chromatin remodeling complexes therefore
appear to act in concert to open up the chromatin for transcription.
Although we have discussed the opening of chromatin structures by
these complexes and its role in transcriptional activation, chromatin remodeling complexes can also produce a more closed chromatin structure leading to transcriptional repression. Hence, these complexes appear to play a
key role in the regulation of gene expression via the alteration of chromatin
structure.

The initial opening of tightly packed chromatin can involve the
binding of pioneer transcription factors
As discussed above, the induction of gene transcription involves a multistage process with the binding of proteins such as the glucocorticoid receptor, or the GAGA factor resulting in the recruitment of chromatin remodeling
complexes which in turn open the chromatin structure so that other factors
can bind and induce transcription.
Clearly, the tightly packed chromatin structure characteristic of inactive
DNA restricts the binding of regulatory proteins until the chromatin has
been opened. This raises the question of how the initial binding of regulatory proteins can take place when the chromatin is still tightly packed. The
solution to this problem appears to be the existence of so-called “pioneer
transcription factors” which can bind to tightly packed chromatin and
open it up so that other factors can bind.
One such pioneer factor is the Forkhead box A1 protein (FoxA1, also
known as HNF-3a). Thus, in the absence of this factor, the estrogen receptor
(ER) cannot bind to its target DNA-binding site, the estrogen response
element (ERE) in tightly packed chromatin (Figure 3.58a) (see Chapter 4,
Section 4.3 and Chapter 5, Section 5.1 for discussion of the ER and its target
binding site). However, the FoxA1 protein can bind to the ERE within such
tightly packed chromatin, opening the chromatin and allowing subsequent
binding by the ER and activation of transcription (Figure 3.58b). Similar
effects in which FoxA1 binding to tightly packed chromatin can facilitate
subsequent binding of the glucocorticoid receptor or the androgen receptor
have also been described, indicating that this effect occurs for multiple

members of the nuclear receptor family of transcription factors (for discussion of this family see Chapter 5, Section 5.1).
The FoxA1 transcription factor has the unusual property that it can bind
both to DNA through its winged helix-turn-helix DNA binding domain (see
Chapter 5, Section 5.1 for discussion of this domain) and to the core histones within the nucleosome via a distinct histone binding domain at the
C-terminus of the protein. It is likely that this dual binding property allows
it to disrupt the DNA–nucleosome interaction, so producing initial chromatin opening and setting off a cascade of events that results in transcription
occurring (Figure 3.59).

3.6

OTHeR SITUATIONS IN WHICH CHROMATIN
STRUCTURe IS RegULATeD

In this chapter we have discussed the role of changes in the chromatin
structure of individual genes in mediating commitment to a particular differentiated state and thereby allowing the tissue-specific activation of gene
expression. However, differences in chromatin structure are also involved in
regulating gene expression in two other well-characterized processes, namely
X-chromosome inactivation and genomic imprinting. Both of these processes
involve differences in expression between the two copies of a specific gene
that are present on different homologous chromosomes in a diploid cell.

In female mammals one of the two X chromosomes
is inactivated
The fact that females of mammalian species have two X chromosomes
whereas males have one X and one Y chromosome, creates a problem of
how to compensate for the difference in dosage of genes on the X chromosome that occurs because females have two copies of each gene whereas
males have only one. In mammals, this problem is solved by the process of
X-chromosome inactivation.
During the process of embryonic development, one of the two X chromosomes in each female cell undergoes an inactivation process so that the
expression of virtually all the genes on this chromosome is inactivated while
those on the other chromosome remain active. This results in each female
cell having only one active copy of X-chromosome genes, paralleling the
situation in male cells which have only one X chromosome to start with
(Figure 3.60).
This process occurs randomly with individual differentiating cells in the
inner cell mass of the early female embryo inactivating either the X chromosome inherited from the father (the paternal X chromosome) or that
inherited from the mother (the maternal X chromosome) (see Chapter 9,
Section 9.1 for discussion of inner cell mass cells and their differentiation to
form the cells that give rise to the different cell types of the embryo).
However, once one or other of the X chromosomes has been inactivated,
the inactivation is propagated stably through cell division to all the progeny
of that cell (Figure 3.60).

Chapter 3: The Epigenome: Role of Chromatin Structure in Gene Control

The active and inactive X chromosomes have a different
chromatin structure
The stable propagation of X-chromosome inactivation is dependent upon the
fact that the inactive and active X chromosomes have a different chromatin
structure. Within the inactive X chromosome, the DNA is tightly packed into
the highly condensed structure of heterochromatin (see Chapter 2, Section
2.5). This high density structure results in the inactive X chromosome being
visible as a distinct element within the cell known as a Barr body.
Such a condensed structure has been shown to exhibit decreased sensitivity to digestion with DNaseI, altered histone modification, and enhanced
methylation on C residues compared with the equivalent regions on the
active X chromosome. For example, 60 of the 61 CpG dinucleotides in the
CpG island (see Section 3.2) located around the promoter of the PGKI gene
are methylated on the C residue when the inactive X chromosome is studied, whereas all these sites are unmethylated on the active X chromosome.
Moreover, treatment with 5-azacytidine which leads to demethylation (see
Section 3.2) can reactivate previously inactivated X-chromosome genes.
As well as changes in DNA methylation, the inactive X chromosome also
exhibits the changes in histones that are characteristic of tightly packed
heterochromatin (see Sections 3.3 and 3.4). These include methylation of
histone H3 on lysines 9 and 27, as well as ubiquitination of histone H2A. In
contrast, the inactive X chromosome shows reduced histone acetylation
and methylation at residues associated with activation such as lysine 4 of
histone H3. Interestingly, the inactive X chromosome is also enriched in the
variant histone, macro H2A, which is associated with transcriptional repression (see Chapter 2, Section 2.3 for discussion of histone variants). Hence,
compared with the active X chromosome, the inactive X chromosome
shows the modifications of DNA and histones associated with a tightly
packed chromatin structure (Figure 3.61).
Interestingly, in Drosophila compensation for the reduced number of X
chromosomes in male cells is achieved in the embryo by doubling the transcriptional activity of the genes on the single male X chromosome rather
than by inactivating one of the female X chromosomes. As in the case of
X-chromosome inactivation however, this effect appears to involve alterations in chromatin structure, since the male X chromosome has a higher
level of acetylated histones than either of the female chromosomes (see
Section 3.3). This effect is due to a protein complex known as the dosage
compensation complex, which contains a histone acetyltransferase enzyme
and which specifically associates with the male X chromosome.

The XIST regulatory RNA is specifically transcribed on the
inactive X chromosome
Chromatin structure therefore plays a critical role in differentially regulating

particular in the maintenance of X-chromosome inactivation through cell
division. The onset of X-chromosome inactivation in the embryo requires a
particular region of the chromosome known as the X-inactivation center
(XIC). If this region is deleted then X inactivation does not occur. A gene
known as XIST has been mapped to the XIC. It has been shown that the
inactivation of one copy of the XIST gene in mutant mice results in a failure
of X-chromosome inactivation on the chromosome which lacks the active
XIST gene, with the other X chromosome being preferentially inactivated
(Figure 3.62a). Hence, XIST is essential for inactivation of the X chromosome from which it is expressed.
The XIST gene within the XIC is transcribed only from the inactive X
chromosome and not on the active chromosome, the opposite pattern to all
other genes on the X chromosome. Its critical role in X inactivation is
demonstrated by the finding that mutant mice that show expression of XIST
from both chromosomes also show inactivation of both X chromosomes.
This is exactly as would be expected if the expression of the XIST gene does
indeed inactivate genes on the X chromosome containing it (Figure 3.62b).
Moreover, if an active XIST gene is placed on a non-X chromosome, the
transcription of the genes on this chromosome is inactivated. Hence, XIST
gene transcription is sufficient to inactivate genes to which it is linked
regardless of the nature of these genes.
It has been shown that the transcription of XIST early in embryonic
development on one of the two chromosomes results in that X chromosome being packed into a tightly packed heterochromatin structure
(Figure 3.63). The XIST gene produces a large 17 kilobase RNA transcript
which is not translated into protein. Rather multiple copies of the XIST
transcript bind all along the length of the inactive X chromosome.
The XIST transcript can spread rapidly along the X chromosome from
the site of its transcription in the XIC. This is because it can move from the
XIC to other regions of the X chromosome that are in close proximity to the
XIC within the looped structure of the chromosome but that may be far
apart along the linear chromosome (see Chapter 2, Section 2.5 for discussion of chromosome looping). This long distance spreading is then followed by local spreading until the entire X chromosome is coated with
XIST (Figure 3.64).
The binding of XIST along the X chromosome then produces a tightly
packed chromatin structure which is incompatible with transcription.
Hence XIST is a member of the class of long noncoding RNAs discussed
in Section 3.4 which regulate gene expression by altering chromatin
structure.
The binding of the XIST RNA to one of the two X chromosomes results
in the recruitment of polycomb complexes (see Section 3.3), which can
methylate histone H3 on lysines 9 and 27 and also ubiquitinate histone H2A
(Figure 3.65). In this way, transcription of XIST on one of the two X chromosomes results in a change in chromatin structure that is propagated
along the rest of that chromosome, switching off all other genes.
In contrast to the transcription of XIST on the inactive X chromosome,
the XIC on the active X chromosome is transcribed to produce a nonprotein-coding transcript, known as TSIX. This transcript is produced from

the opposite strand of the DNA to that which produces XIST and the two
transcripts overlap (Figure 3.66).
Such transcription of TSIX by the active X chromosome is necessary
for X-chromosome inactivation, since inactivation of TSIX interferes with
this process. Like XIST, TSIX also functions by recruiting protein complexes
which can alter chromatin structure. Thus, for example, it has been shown
that TSIX can recruit the Dnmt3a, DNA methyltransferase enzyme (see
Section 3.2). Dnmt3a then methylates C residues within the promoter
responsible for XIST transcription, thereby preventing the expression of
XIST and in turn preventing the inactivation of the TSIX-expressing X chromosome (Figure 3.67).
The initiation and maintenance of X-chromosome inactivation therefore
requires the ability to produce and stably propagate an altered chromatin
structure, which we have previously seen to be critical in tissue-specific
gene regulation. Moreover, like the regulation of the chromatin structure of
individual genes, it involves processes such as methylation of C residues in
the DNA, modification of histones, and the organization of a tightly packed
chromatin structure by inhibitory lncRNAs.

Genomic imprinting resembles X-chromosome inactivation in that one of
the two copies of specific genes is inactivated while the other remains
active. This process differs however, in that about 100 genes scattered on a
number of different chromosomes have been shown to be imprinted in
mammals. Moreover, unlike X-chromosome inactivation, the same copy is
always inactivated in all cells and in all organisms whether male or female.
It is always the maternally inherited copy of some imprinted genes, such as
the genes encoding the insulin-like growth factor 2 (IGF2) protein, the SmN
splicing protein, and the U2AF35-related protein which are inactivated,

Transcription of XiST produces a 17 kilobase

so producing a tightly packed inactive
chromatin structure.

OTHER SITUATIONS IN WHICH CHROMATIN STRUCTURE IS REGULATED
with the paternally inherited gene remaining active. Conversely the paternally inherited copies of other imprinted genes, such as the Igf 2 receptor
gene and the H19 gene, are inactivated with the maternally inherited gene
remaining active (Figure 3.68).
As with X-chromosome inactivation therefore, this process results in all
cells having only one functional copy of each of these genes, although in
the case of genomic imprinting all cells express the same copy. This process
cannot be reversed during embryonic development, even when genetic
crosses are used to produce embryos with two imprinted copies of the gene.
Embryos which inherit two maternal and no paternal copies of the Igf 2 gene
or two maternal but no paternal copies of the SmN gene die due to the lack
of an active gene and therefore of a functional protein even though two
copies of the gene capable of encoding this protein are present in each cell
of the embryo.
Despite the lethal effects that can result when imprinting goes wrong,
the normal function of this process is unclear. It has been suggested, for
example, that imprinting may represent a means of preventing the parthenogenetic development of the unfertilized egg to produce a haploid embryo
with no paternal contribution. Alternatively, it may have evolved because of
the conflict between the maternal and paternal genomes in terms of the
transfer of nutrients from mother to offspring. Although it is in the paternal
interest to promote the growth of the individual fetus, the maternal interest
is to restrict the growth of any individual fetus so that other fetuses fathered
by different males, either concurrently (in multi-fetal litters) or subsequently,
can develop fully. Other theories range from the need for the cell to distinguish between the two copies of each chromosome that have been inherited from the mother or the father to a mechanism for producing differences
between male and female offspring.
This lack of a clear functional role for genomic imprinting is in contrast
to the clear role of X-chromosome inactivation in compensating for the
extra X chromosome in females compared with males. Indeed it has even
been suggested that imprinting may not have a function at all but may represent a vestige of an evolutionarily ancient defense system to inactivate
foreign DNA, with the imprinted genes having some feature that causes this
system to consider them as foreign.
All these ideas suggest one potential overall function or vestigial role
for the entire process of imprinting. It is also possible however, that the
functional role for imprinting differs for different imprinted genes. Thus, for
example, in the case of the maternally imprinted Igf 2 gene, it has been
shown that such imprinting is necessary to maintain a low level of IGF2
expression in quiescent hematopoietic stem cells, so preventing them from
dividing and differentiating prematurely.

Imprinting involves changes in chromatin structure
Whatever its precise function, it is clear that genomic imprinting resembles
X-chromosome inactivation in that specific differences exist in the methylation pattern of CG dinucleotides between the active and inactive copies of
the imprinted gene. Moreover, embryos that lack the DNA methyltransferase
Dnmt3a (see Section 3.2) fail to carry out genomic imprinting. Hence specific methylation of one of the two copies of the gene is critical for imprinting to occur.
Interestingly, in some cases, the role of C methylation in regulating
imprinting can be quite complex. In the case of the H19 gene which is
silenced on the paternal chromosome, a simple correlation exists with the
regulatory region of the gene being methylated on the paternal chromosome but not on the maternal as would be expected (Figure 3.69). However,
in the case of the adjacent Ig f 2 gene which is silenced on the maternal
chromosome, no specific methylation pattern is evident on this chromosome compared to the paternal one. Rather, the activity of the Ig f 2 gene is
controlled by an imprinting control region (ICR), which is located between
the H19 and Ig f 2 genes and is methylated on the paternal chromosome
where the Ig f 2 gene is active.

This paradox is resolved by the finding that when the ICR is methylated,
a positive regulatory element (known as an enhancer, see Chapter 4,
Section 4.4) located downstream of the H19 gene acts at a distance to activate Ig f 2 gene expression (Figure 3.69). In contrast, when the ICR is
unmethylated on the maternal chromosome, the CTCF protein binds to it.
This protein produces an insulator effect (see Chapter 2, Section 2.5 for
discussion of CTCF and its binding to insulator elements), preventing the
positive regulatory element from activating Ig f 2 and the gene is therefore
silent. In agreement with this idea, mutations in the binding site for CTCF
disrupt the correct pattern of expression of the H19 and Ig f 2 genes. Hence,
in this chromosomal region, methylation of C residues on the paternal
chromosome results in silencing of the H19 gene and expression of the
Ig f 2 gene on this chromosome.
As well as DNA methylation, the Ig f 2/H19 system also involves several
other features of chromatin structure that have been discussed elsewhere.
For example, CTCF is able to recruit the CHD8 protein, which is a chromodomain-containing helicase protein (see Section 3.3) able to remodel

the imprinting control region (iCR) on the

an insulator protein (CTCf) and allows a
distinct positive regulatory element (PRE) to
specifically activate Igf 2 expression only on
the paternal chromosome.

chromatin structure to a more tightly packed configuration (Figure 3.70).
This idea that CTCF fulfils its insulator role by altering chromatin structure
has been confirmed by studies in the β-globin gene cluster, where as discussed in Chapter 2 (Section 2.5) binding of CTCF has been shown to promote looping of the chromatin. Hence, CTCF can remodel the chromatin, to
create a boundary between regions of DNA with different chromatin structures (Figure 3.70).
The H19 gene does not produce a protein but rather produces an lncRNA
which, as described above, has the opposite pattern of expression to that of
the protein coding Ig f 2 gene (Figure 3.70). This pattern of protein coding
genes being expressed on the opposite chromosome to that expressing an
lncRNA is seen in several other imprinted gene clusters where the lncRNA
regulates the imprinting of several adjacent genes. For example, the Air
lncRNA transcript overlaps that of the Ig f 2 receptor gene but is transcribed
from the opposite strand of the DNA. The Air RNA is transcribed only from
the paternal chromosome and specifically silences the Ig f 2 receptor gene on
this chromosome. This results in the Ig f 2 receptor gene being expressed
only from the maternal chromosome. In addition, the Air RNA also silences
two other imprinted genes (Sic22a2 and Sic22a3) on the paternal chromosome (Figure 3.71).
Interestingly, the silencing effect of Air on the Ig f 2 receptor gene is
dependent on the transcription of the Air RNA passing through the promoter for the Ig f 2 receptor gene (Figure 3.71). This prevents the recruitment
of RNA polymerase II to the promoter and so prevents transcription of the
Ig f 2 receptor gene (Figure 3.71). In contrast, the Air transcript does not overlap the Sic22a2 or Sic22a3 genes so this mechanism cannot be used. Rather,
imprinting of these two genes has been shown to involve the Air RNA binding to the genes and recruiting histone methyltransferases that methylate

Chapter 3: The Epigenome: Role of Chromatin Structure in Gene Control

histone H3 on lysine 9, a modification which, as described above (Section
3.3) is associated with a tightly packed chromatin structure.
Hence in imprinting, as with XIST (see above), transcription of an lncRNA
on a particular chromosome is involved in silencing protein-coding genes
on that chromosome by producing a tightly packed chromatin structure
incompatible with transcription.
It is clear therefore that imprinting involves similar modifications and
changes in chromatin structure to those that are used to regulate cellular
commitment and gene transcription in specific cell types as well as in
X-chromosome inactivation. Moreover, although X-chromosome inactivation
in embryonic cells differs from imprinting in that it is random rather than specifically inactivating either the paternal or maternal X chromosome, this is not
always the case. As discussed in Chapter 9 (Section 9.1) X-chromosome inactivation in extra-embryonic tissue always targets the paternal X chromosome,
although the mechanisms of such inactivation are similar to those in embryonic cells and for example involve XIST.

CONCLUSIONS
A variety of changes take place in the chromatin of genes during the process
of commitment to a particular pathway of differentiation. Such changes
involve both modification of the DNA itself by undermethylation, to the histones with which it is associated, and to the general packaging of the DNA
in chromatin. The study of these changes has moved from the simple
description of changes such as DNaseI sensitivity to a more mechanistic
approach. This has identified three key processes regulating chromatin
structure, namely, DNA methylation (Section 3.2), histone modifications,
particularly acetylation and methylation (Section 3.3), and ATP-dependent
remodeling of chromatin structure by complexes such as SWI/SNF and
NURF (Section 3.5).
As described in earlier sections it is now possible to use high-throughput
methods to characterize the distribution across the entire genome of DNA
methylation (Section 3.2), histone modifications (Section 3.3), DNaseI hypersensitive sites (Section 3.4), and nucleosome positioning (Chapter 2, Section
2.2). These distributions can be integrated with one another to produce a
complete picture of the epigenome in different cell types and under different
conditions (Figure 3.72).
Such descriptive analyses reveal a close relationship between the different aspects of the epigenome which is not surprising given that these
processes are closely linked to one another mechanistically as described
earlier, with, for example, DNA methylation stimulating histone changes
such as deacetylation and methylation, while in turn such changes in
histone modification can regulate SWI/SNF recruitment to the promoter
(see Section 3.4).
Although protein complexes able to, for example, methylate DNA or
modify histones, play a key role in these events, it is clear that regulatory
RNA molecules which do not encode proteins are also involved in controlling chromatin structure. These include the small siRNAs (Section 3.4),
as well as larger noncoding RNAs such as antisense transcripts (Section
3.4), the XIST RNA (Section 3.6), and noncoding transcripts such as Air
involved in imprinting (Section 3.6).
Although all these RNAs produce an inhibitory effect, other lncRNAs
such as that transcribed from the CEBPA locus (see Section 3.4) can stimulate gene expression (see also, Chapter 4, Section 4.4 and Chapter 8, Section
8.1), suggesting that regulatory RNAs may have widespread roles. This may
provide an explanation for an unexpected finding of the ENCODE human
genome project (see Chapter 4, Section 4.3 for discussion of this project).
This study demonstrated that a very large proportion of the human genome
which cannot encode protein is nonetheless transcribed into RNA. Moreover,
it also identified many antisense RNAs which overlap with sense transcripts
from protein-coding genes.

KEY CONCEPTS
The combination of all the various processes discussed in this chapter results in three basic levels of chromatin structure within the cell
(Figure 3.73). Although the bulk of inactive DNA is organized into a
tightly packed 30 nm fiber structure, active or potentially active genes
are organized into a more open beads-on-a-string structure, and short
regions within the gene are either nucleosome-free or have structurally
altered nucleosomes.
The role of these changes in allowing cells to maintain a commitment
to a particular differentiated state and to respond differently to inducers of
gene expression is well illustrated in the case of the steroid hormones and
their effect on gene expression. As described in Chapter 2 (Introduction)
different tissues will respond differently to treatment with estrogen and this
will occur even though they contain the appropriate receptor for the hormone (see Chapter 5, Section 5.1). This is likely to be due to the fact that in
one tissue, certain steroid-responsive genes will be inaccessible within the
30 nm fiber structure and will therefore be incapable of binding the receptor–hormone complex that is necessary for activation. In other genes,
which are in the beads-on-a-string structure and therefore more accessible, such binding of the complex to defined sequences in the gene will
occur. Even in this case, however, gene activation will not occur as a direct
consequence of this interaction, as might be the case in bacteria. Rather,
the binding will result in the displacement of a nucleosome from the region
of DNA, generating a hypersensitive site and allowing other regulatory proteins to interact with their specific recognition sequences and cause transcription to occur.
Both the action of the receptor–hormone complex and the subsequent
binding of other transcription factors to nucleosome-free DNA clearly
involve the interaction of regulatory proteins with specific DNA sequences
that are exposed within the epigenome/chromatin structure to regulate
transcription by RNA polymerase II. The basic process of transcription will
be described in Chapter 4 and its regulation by specific transcription factors
will be discussed in Chapter 5.

KeY CONCePTS
•

In eukaryotes gene regulation involves long-term changes which
allow a cell to become and remain committed to a particular
pattern of gene expression.

•

These changes occur before a gene becomes active and involve an
alteration in the chromatin structure of the whole gene from the
tightly packed 30 nm fiber structure to the more open beads-on-astring structure.

•

These changes do not alter the genomic sequence of the DNA but
instead involve modifications to the DNA and the histones
associated with it.

•

This results in an “epigenome” which can vary in different cells
and under different conditions.

•

In particular, the chromatin of active or potentially active genes
exhibits:
(a) Enhanced sensitivity to digestion with DNaseI.
(b) Undermethylation on specific C residues in the DNA.
(c) Changes in the post-translational modifications of the histones
associated with the DNA.

The Process of Transcription

INTRODUCTION
As discussed in Chapter 1 (Section 1.4), a variety of evidence demonstrates
that gene regulation primarily operates at the level of transcription, determining which genes will be transcribed into RNA in specific tissues or in
response to specific stimuli. In part, such transcriptional control operates at
the level of chromatin structure so that the DNA that is to be transcribed
moves to a more open chromatin structure allowing access to regulatory
molecules (see Chapters 2 and 3).
Although such an open chromatin structure is required for the transcription of the gene, the actual process of transcription involves RNA polymerase enzymes that can copy the DNA into RNA together with a variety of
transcription factors that can stimulate or inhibit polymerase activity. This
process of transcription by RNA polymerases is a major target for the regulation of gene expression. Accordingly, the basic processes of transcription
itself will be discussed in this chapter and its regulation by specific transcription factors will be discussed in Chapter 5.

4.1 TRANSCRIPTION BY RNA POLYMERASES
Enzymes that are capable of using the DNA as a template so that a complementary RNA copy is produced by the polymerization of ribonucleotides are
referred to as RNA polymerases. In prokaryotes a single RNA polymerase
enzyme is responsible for the transcription of DNA into RNA. In eukaryotes
however, this is not the case and several such enzymes exist.
Three RNA polymerase enzymes are found in the nucleus of all eukaryotes and are known as RNA polymerases I, II, and III. In addition, plants
contain two further enzymes (RNA polymerases IV and V, which in these
organisms are involved in the production of an inhibitory chromatin structure by small interfering RNAs, siRNAs) (see Chapter 1, Section 1.5 and
Chapter 3, Section 3.4).
RNA polymerases I, II, and III are large multi-subunit enzymes and several
subunits are held in common between the three enzymes. The three enzymes
can be distinguished however, by their relative sensitivity to the fungal toxin
α-amanitin and each of them is active on a distinct set of genes (Table 4.1).
All genes capable of encoding a protein, as well as the genes for some small
nuclear RNAs involved in RNA splicing (see Chapter 6, Section 6.3) are
transcribed by RNA polymerase II. In contrast, the genes encoding the 28S,
18S, and 5.8S ribosomal RNAs (see Chapter 6, Section 6.6) are transcribed as
a 45S precursor by RNA polymerase I and those encoding the transfer RNAs
and the 5S ribosomal RNA are transcribed by RNA polymerase III.
In considering the transcriptional regulatory processes that produce
tissue-specific variation in specific mRNAs and proteins, our primary concern

will therefore be with the regulation of transcription by RNA polymerase II.
Transcription by RNA polymerases I and III is also subject to regulation however. Moreover, the nature of the components involved in transcription by
these polymerases is much simpler than those which are involved in transcription by RNA polymerase II. A prior understanding of the processes
involved in basal transcription by RNA polymerases I and III therefore assists
a subsequent understanding of the more complex processes involved in
basal transcription by RNA polymerase II. Transcription by RNA polymerases
I, III, and II will therefore be considered in turn.

Transcription of DNA
FIgURE 4.1
Schematic diagram showing the structure of
RNA polymerase I (shaded) with a cleft into
which the DNA can enter (a). The structure
can then pivot, enclosing the DNA and
allowing transcription to begin (b).

Transcription by RNA polymerase I is relatively simple
RNA polymerase I is responsible for the transcription of the tandem arrays of
genes encoding ribosomal RNA, such transcription constituting about onehalf of total cellular transcription. As is the case for all the RNA polymerases,
RNA polymerase I has multiple subunits. The structure of the 14 subunit RNA
polymerase I from yeast has been determined by electron microscopy and by
X-ray crystallography. Interestingly, the multi-subunit polymerase has a
structure that contains a wide cleft into which the DNA can fit. Once the DNA
has entered this cleft, the structure pivots around a hinge region, thereby
enclosing the DNA and allowing transcription to occur (Figure 4.1).
Hence, the DNA being transcribed is closely associated with RNA polymerase I during the process of transcription. However, as with all RNA polymerases, RNA polymerase I is not recruited to the DNA by direct binding of
the polymerase to DNA sequences around the start site of transcription.
Rather, other protein factors recognize such sequences and then recruit the
RNA polymerase by protein–protein interactions. In the case of RNA polymerase I, the essential DNA sequences that are recognized are located
within the 100 bases immediately upstream of the start site of transcription.
As in all genes, the sequences adjacent to the transcriptional start site that
control the expression of the gene are known as the gene promoter (see
Section 4.3 for more detailed discussion of gene promoters). Note that in the
case of all the RNA polymerases the site at which transcription begins is
denoted as +1 with bases within the transcribed region being denoted as
+100, +200, etc., while bases upstream of the start site are denoted as –100,
–200, etc., as one proceeds further and further upstream (see Figure 4.2).

nucleotides within the transcribed region while – signs denote bases
upstream of the transcriptional start site.

In the case of RNA polymerase I, sequences around –50 are recognized by
a protein transcription factor known as UBF (upstream binding factor).
Subsequently another regulatory protein known as SL1 (also known as TIF-IB)
is recruited via protein–protein interaction with UBF. In turn SL1 recruits the
RNA polymerase itself and several associated factors (Figure 4.2). Hence the
initiation of transcription by RNA polymerase I is relatively simple, with one
essential transcription factor (SL1) being necessary to recruit the RNA polymerase itself. In turn the binding of this essential factor is facilitated by the prior
binding of another transcription factor, UBF, to an upstream DNA sequence.

Transcription by RNA polymerase III is more complex than
for RNA polymerase I
The involvement of a specific transcription factor which acts to recruit the
RNA polymerase as well as of other factors which recruit the specific factor
is also illustrated by RNA polymerase III.
The situation is complicated however, by the fact that in different genes
that are transcribed by RNA polymerase III, the essential promoter DNA
sequences recognized by the transcription factors that recruit the polymerase can be located either upstream or within the transcribed region. Genes
transcribed by RNA polymerase III can therefore have either an upstream
promoter (as is the case for genes transcribed by RNA polymerase I and II)
or an internal promoter located within the transcribed region.
This type of internal promoter which is unique to RNA polymerase III
was first identified by detailed studies that focused on the genes that encode
the 5S RNA of the ribosome. In an attempt to identify the sequences important for the expression of this gene, sequences surrounding it were deleted
and the effect on the transcription of the gene in a cell-free system was
investigated. Somewhat surprisingly, the entire upstream region of the gene
could be deleted with no effect on gene expression (Figure 4.3). Indeed,

deletions within the transcribed region of the 5S rRNA gene also had no
effect on its expression until a boundary 40 bases within the transcribed
region was crossed. By this means, an internal control region essential for
the transcription of the 5S rRNA gene was defined, which is located entirely
within the transcribed region.
This region of the 5S rRNA gene was shown subsequently to bind a
transcription factor known as TFIIIA, using a DNaseI footprinting assay
(Figure 4.4) (see Section 4.3 and Methods Box 4.2 for description of this
assay of DNA–protein binding). Subsequently, another transcription factor,
TFIIIC, binds to the DNA adjacent to TFIIIA and in turn TFIIIC functions to
recruit a further transcription factor, TFIIIB, to form a stable transcription
complex (Figure 4.5).
This transcriptional complex, which is stable through many cell divisions, promotes the subsequent binding of RNA polymerase III. The polymerase is recruited via a protein–protein interaction with TFIIIB and binds at
the transcriptional start site (Figure 4.5). The binding of RNA polymerase III
is dependent on the presence of the stable transcription complex and not on
the precise sequence of the DNA to which it binds since, as discussed above,
the region to which the polymerase normally binds can be deleted and
replaced by other sequences without drastically reducing transcription.
Although the assembly of transcription complexes on RNA polymerase
III genes was first defined on the 5S ribosomal RNA gene, other RNA polymerase III transcription units differ in the details of transcription complex
assembly. For example, the genes encoding the transfer RNAs which play a
key role in translation (see Chapter 6, Section 6.6), also have an internal
promoter. However, in this case due to differences in the sequence of the

then recruits RNA polymerase II and its associated factor TFIIF (c). TFIIe
and TFIIh then bind and TFIIh phosphorylates the c-terminal domain of
RNA polymerase II (d). This converts RNA polymerase II into a form that
is capable of initiating transcription and RNA polymerase II and TFIIF then
move off down the gene producing the RNA transcript, leaving TFIIA and
TFIID bound at the promoter (e).

promoter TFIIIA is not required. Rather, TFIIIC binds directly to sequences
within the internal promoter, and subsequently recruits TFIIIB. As in the 5S
rRNA promoters, TFIIIB then recruits the RNA polymerase itself.
Similarly, TFIIIB plays a critical role in transcription of the RNA polymerase III genes that have an upstream promoter. An example of such an
upstream promoter is found in the gene encoding the small nuclear RNA
U6, which unlike the other small nuclear RNAs of the splicesosome (see
Chapter 6, Section 6.3) is transcribed by RNA polymerase III rather than RNA
polymerase II (Table 4.1).
It is clear therefore that TFIIIB plays an essential role in the transcription
of the three different types of RNA polymerase III gene promoters and is the
functional equivalent of the RNA polymerase I SL1 factor, which acts directly
to recruit the RNA polymerase via protein–protein interaction.

Transcription by RNA polymerase II is much more complex than
transcription by RNA polymerases I and III
Inspection of the region immediately upstream of the transcriptional start
site reveals that a variety of different genes transcribed by RNA polymerase II contain an AT-rich sequence approximately 30 nucleotides upstream
of the transcription start site. In the genes that contain it, the TATA box
plays a critical role in promoting transcriptional initiation and in positioning the start site of transcription for RNA polymerase II. Its destruction by
mutation or deletion effectively abolishes transcription of genes that normally contain it.
Most importantly, this TATA box acts as a classic example of the initial
DNA target site for the progressive assembly of the basal pre-initiation transcription complex for RNA polymerase II, which involves considerably more
factors than those for RNA polymerase I or III. Initially, the TATA box is
bound by the transcription factor TFIID whose binding is facilitated by the
presence of another transcription factor, TFIIA (Figure 4.6a). Interestingly,
structural analysis of TFIID has revealed it to have a molecular clamp structure which consists of four globular domains around an accessible groove
which can accommodate the DNA to which TFIID binds (Figure 4.7).
Subsequently, the TFIID/DNA complex is recognized by another transcription factor TFIIB (Figure 4.6b). Structural analysis has shown that
TFIIB binds on the opposite side of the DNA to that which is bound by TFIIA
(Figure 4.8). TFIIB then contacts specific DNA sequences located on either
side of the TATA box which are known as the upstream and downstream
BREs (Figure 4.8 and Figure 4.9).
The binding of TFIIB is an essential step in the formation of the preinitiation complex since, as well as binding to TFIID, TFIIB can also recruit
RNA polymerase II itself. The binding of TFIIB therefore allows the

subsequent recruitment of RNA polymerase II in association with another
factor, TFIIF, to the initiation complex (Figure 4.6c). Subsequently, two
other factors (TFIIE and TFIIH) associate to form the full pre-initiation
complex (Figure 4.6d). The various stages in the assembly of the preinitiation complex have now been visualized by electron microscopy
(Figure 4.10).
In particular, the recruitment of TFIIH plays a critical role in allowing the
RNA polymerase to initiate transcription. TFIIH is a multicomponent complex whose molecular structure has been determined and which plays a key
role in both transcription and the repair of damaged DNA. One component
of TFIIH has a kinase activity. This kinase is capable of phosphorylating the
C-terminal domain of the largest subunit of RNA polymerase II, which is
known as RPB1. The C-terminal domain of RPB1 contains multiple copies of
the sequence Tyr-Ser-Pro-Thr-Ser-Pro-Ser, which is unique to RNA polymerase II and is highly evolutionarily conserved. The kinase activity of TFIIH
phosphorylates serine 5 within this repeat and this allows transcription initiation to occur (Figure 4.11). Phosphorylation of the C-terminal domain
therefore plays a critical role in allowing the polymerase to initiate transcription. Although the dephosphorylated form of RNA polymerase II is
recruited to the DNA, its phosphorylation is necessary for transcription to
produce the RNA product (Figure 4.6e).
Both the RNA polymerase II/TFIIB complex and an active transcription
complex have been crystallized allowing structural analysis (Figure 4.12).

the polymerase molecule, it encounters a wall of protein within the RNA
polymerase (labeled A in Figure 4.13). This forces it to make a right-angled
turn, exposing the end of the nascent RNA and allowing ribonucleoside
triphosphates to be added to it as transcription occurs. Subsequently, the
newly formed DNA–RNA hybrid produced as a consequence of transcription
encounters another part of RNA polymerase, known as the rudder (labeled
B in Figure 4.13). This rudder region forces the separation of the RNA from
the DNA. This allows the newly formed part of the RNA molecule to exit and
double-stranded DNA to reform (Figure 4.13).
Interestingly, this complex interaction of the DNA and RNA polymerase
is facilitated by TFIIB. Structural studies of the RNA polymerase/TFIIB complex have shown that TFIIB does more than simply recruit the polymerase.
By interacting with TFIID bound to the TATA box, DNA sequences on either
side of the TATA box, and the polymerase itself in a very precise structure,
TFIIB ensures that the DNA and the polymerase molecule are correctly positioned and oriented relative to one another for the DNA to enter the interior
of the polymerase, allowing transcription to occur (Figure 4.12).
As the polymerase moves off down the gene, TFIIF remains associated
with it while TFIIA and TFIID remain bound at the promoter, allowing further cycles of recruitment of TFIIB, RNA polymerase II, etc., leading to
repeated rounds of transcription (Figure 4.6e).
Such a role of TFIIA and TFIID in allowing repeated rounds of transcription is of particular interest in view of the finding that some RNA polymerase is found within the cell associated with a large number of proteins
including TFIIB, TFIIF, and TFIIH to form a so-called RNA polymerase
holoenzyme. In addition to the stepwise pathway involving progressive
recruitment of TFIIB, RNA polymerase, and TFIIH individually, it appears
that an alternative pathway exists in which TFIIA and TFIID can recruit a
holoenzyme complex containing TFIIB, TFIIE, TFIIF, TFIIH, and RNA polymerase itself (Figure 4.14). In addition, the holoenzyme also contains a
number of other protein components that appear to be involved either in
opening up the chromatin structure so as to allow transcription to occur

Plants contain two additional RNA polymerases which are
related to RNA polymerase II and play a key role in gene
silencing by small RNAs
Although all eukaryotes contain RNA polymerases I, II, and III, plants possess two additional enzymes able to transcribe DNA into RNA, namely RNA
polymerases IV and V. Both of these RNA polymerases are closely related to
RNA polymerase II. Thus, RNA polymerases II, IV, and V are all multiprotein
enzymes each composed of 12 different subunits. In the well-studied plant
Arabidopsis thaliana, six of these subunits are identical in the three RNA
polymerases and are encoded by the same genes. Moreover, the remaining
subunits of RNA polymerases IV and/or V are closely related to the corresponding subunits of RNA polymerase II and appear to be encoded by
closely related genes (Figure 4.15). It is likely that such genes are the result
of gene duplication events with subsequent evolutionary divergence to produce proteins which are related to one another but which have diverged
sufficiently to allow the different polymerases to have different functions.
In plants such as Arabidopsis thaliana, RNA polymerases IV and V play a
key role in the silencing of gene transcription by small RNAs. Thus, in contrast to the post-transcriptional effects of many small RNAs (see Chapter 7,
Section 7.7), some small RNAs can act at the transcriptional level by altering
chromatin structure (see Chapter 3, Section 3.4).
In Arabidopsis thaliana, it has been shown that polymerases IV and V act
together in the production of an inactive chromatin structure by small RNA
molecules. Thus, RNA polymerase IV transcribes specific DNA sequences to
produce single-stranded RNA molecules (Figure 4.16a). These are then rendered double-stranded by the enzyme RDR2 (RNA-dependent RNA polymerase
2), which unlike the RNA polymerases we have been discussing so far uses
RNA rather than DNA as its substrate (Figure 4.16b). This double-stranded
RNA is now a substrate for production of single-stranded siRNA bound to an
RITS–Argonaute 4 protein complex (Figure 4.16c) that can repress gene
transcription by organizing an inactive chromatin structure (see Chapter 1,
Section 1.5 and Chapter 3, Section 3.4 for discussion of siRNA production).
The target for the siRNA produced by RNA polymerase IV-mediated transcription is an RNA produced by polymerase V-mediated transcription of the
gene to be repressed (Figure 4.16d). This transcript remains associated
with the target gene and the siRNA binds to it (Figure 4.16e). Such binding
then results in the recruitment of enzymes which can produce epigenetic
changes associated with a tightly packed chromatin structure such as DNA
methylation, histone deacetylation, and histone methylation on inhibitory

residues such as lysines 9 and 27 of histone H3 (Figure 4.16f) (see Chapter
3 for discussion of these epigenetic effects). Hence, in plants, RNA polymerases IV and V co-operate together to produce target gene inhibition.

Transcription by RNA polymerases I, II, and III has a number
of common features
Although RNA polymerases I and III are not as closely related to RNA polymerase II as RNA polymerases IV and V, they are also multi-subunit proteins
with several subunits being shared between the RNA polymerases I, II, and
III. Thus, RNA polymerases I, II, and III each have two large subunits, which
are related to one another and to the β′ and β subunits of the single bacterial
RNA polymerase enzyme (Figure 4.17). They also all contain the same
ω-like subunit.
In addition, RNA polymerases I and III share the same two α-like subunits, whereas RNA polymerase II has two α subunits which are related to but
distinct from those of the other two polymerases. Again, these ω- and α-like
subunits are related to the corresponding subunits of the bacterial enzyme.
In addition however, all three eukaryotic RNA polymerases also contain
four common subunits which are not found in the bacterial enzyme and
between three and seven subunits which are unique to one or other of the
eukaryotic polymerases (Figure 4.17).
Each of the three eukaryotic polymerases shows a similar pattern of
recruitment to the DNA, with one specific transcription factor binding to a
target sequence in the gene promoter followed by binding of one or more
other proteins that then recruit the polymerase itself. As discussed above, in
the case of RNA polymerase II promoters which contain a TATA box, the

original binding to DNA is achieved by the TFIID factor which binds to the
TATA box.
Interestingly however, although TFIID was originally identified as a single factor it is now clear that it is composed of multiple protein components.
One of these proteins known as TBP (TATA-binding protein) is responsible
for binding to the TATA box, while the other components of the complex,
known as TAFs (TBP-associated factors) do not bind directly to the TATA
box but appear to allow TFIID to respond to stimulation by transcriptional
activators (see Chapter 5, Section 5.2). The manner in which TBP and the
various TAFs form the TFIID complex and their positions within it have been
determined by electron microscopic analysis (Figure 4.18).

TRANSCRIPTION BY RNA POLYMERASES
Studies of TBP bound to DNA have shown that binding of TBP bends
the DNA so that it follows the curve of a saddle structure within TBP
(Figure 4.19). The structure of TFIID (consisting of TBP and the TAFs)
bound to DNA resembles that of the core nucleosome of eight histone molecules which forms the normal structure of chromatin (see Chapter 2,
Section 2.2). This suggests that TFIID bends the DNA at the promoter in a
similar way to the bending of DNA around the nucleosomes in the remaining DNA. In this regard, it is of interest that as discussed in Chapter 3 (Section
3.3) the TAFII250 subunit of TFIID has histone acetyltransferase activity,
allowing it to modulate chromatin structure by acetylating histones.
Although many of the genes transcribed by RNA polymerase II contain a
TATA box, a subset of RNA polymerase II genes do not contain the TATA box
but instead have an initiator sequence (Inr) located around the transcriptional start site. Paradoxically however, TBP also plays a key role in the
transcription of this class of RNA polymerase II genes. In this case, TBP is
recruited to the DNA in association with the TAFs which allow the TFIID
complex to bind to these promoters. Such binding is then followed by
recruitment of TFIIB and the RNA polymerase itself, as occurs for promoters
containing a TATA box. Hence TBP plays a central role in the assembly of
the transcription complex for RNA polymerase II, whether or not the promoter contains a TATA box.
Therefore these findings indicate that TBP may be a basic transcription
factor, which is essential for transcription by RNA polymerase II, paralleling
the role of SL1 for RNA polymerase I and of TFIIIB for RNA polymerase III.
This idea is supported by the amazing finding that TBP is actually also a
component of both SL1 and TFIIIB. Thus SL1 is not a single protein but is
actually a complex of four factors, one of which is TBP. Hence the recruitment of SL1 to an RNA polymerase I promoter by UBF (see above), results
in the delivery of TBP to the DNA.
Similarly, TFIIIB is a complex of TBP and two other proteins, Bdpl and
Brf1. In the 5S rRNA and tRNA genes, TBP is delivered to the promoter as
part of the TFIIIB complex following prior binding of either TFIIIA or
TFIIIC. Moreover, since some RNA polymerase III genes, such as the U6
RNA gene contain an upstream promoter with a TATA box, in this case
TBP can bind directly to the promoter (Figure 4.20). Remarkably,

Transcription of promoters by RNA polymerase III involves the

achieved by protein–protein interactions with either TFIIIA and TFIIIc
or TFIIIc alone in the case of promoters lacking a TATA box (a) or by
direct binding to the TATA box where this is present (b).

following its direct or indirect recruitment to the DNA, TBP can then
make a variety of further contacts within the transcriptional complexes
for RNA polymerases I, II, and III to enhance assembly and/or activity of
the complexes and these have now been defined by structural analysis
(Figure 4.21).
The multiple protein–protein and protein–DNA interactions that we have
discussed above appear to serve merely to recruit TBP to the DNA which, in
the case of all three polymerases, then leads directly or indirectly to the
recruitment of the RNA polymerase itself. It has therefore been suggested
that TBP represents an evolutionarily ancient transcription factor whose
existence precedes the evolution of three independent eukaryotic RNA polymerases and which therefore plays a universal and essential role in eukaryotic transcription. In agreement with this idea, a TBP homolog has been
identified in the Archaea. As these organisms constitute a separate kingdom
distinct from Bacteria and Eukaryotes, it is clear that TBP is an evolutionarily ancient protein that pre-dates the divergence of the Archaean and
Eukaryotic kingdoms.
Initially, it was believed that each organism would have only one TBP
protein. It has now become clear however, that other TBP-like proteins exist
in multicellular organisms. Thus, in addition to TBP itself, all multicellular
organisms contain a protein known as TLF (TBP-like factor, also known as
TRF2), while additional TBP-like proteins are found specifically in insects
(TRF1) and vertebrates (TRF3).
Interestingly, these TBP-related factors (TRFs) substitute for TBP in the
basal transcriptional complex which assembles on certain specific RNA polymerase II-transcribed genes. For example, in the frog Xenopus, inactivation
of TBP prevents the transcription of only a relatively few genes in the early
embryo, with the majority of embryo-specific genes being dependent on
TLF/TRF2 or TRF3 for their transcription.
Similarly, TRF3 appears to substitute for TBP in terminally differentiated muscle myotubes. This results in the preferential transcription of
muscle-specific genes that can be transcribed in a TRF3-dependent manner,
while TBP-dependent non-muscle-specific genes are not transcribed (see
Chapter 10, Section 10.1 for further discussion of muscle-specific gene
transcription).
Hence, the basal transcriptional complex that assembles on some genes
will contain a TRF rather than TBP and this is required for transcription
of these genes (Figure 4.22a and b). Indeed, in some cases it has been
demonstrated that a basal transcriptional complex can assemble without
either TBP or a TRF, with another factor presumably fulfilling their role
(Figure 4.22c). These effects evidently offer a means of differentially regulating the expression of genes with differing requirements for TBP or TRFs
in a particular cell type.

TRANSCRIPTION BY RNA POLYMERASES

127

It is clear therefore, that TBP is an evolutionarily ancient transcription factor, which is involved in transcription by all three RNA polymerases (Figure
4.21). In the case of some genes, however, transcription can occur in a TBPindependent manner involving either a TRF or a complex lacking TBP or TRFs.

Transcription takes place in defined regions of the nucleus
It has been known for many years that transcription of the ribosomal RNA
genes by RNA polymerase I takes place in a defined region of the nucleus.
This region is known as the nucleolus and can be readily visualized by
light or electron microscopy (Figure 4.23). It contains several hundred
copies of the ribosomal RNA genes which are tandemly repeated along the
chromosome. The nucleolus also contains proteins involved in transcription
of the ribosomal RNA genes by RNA polymerase I (see above) as well as the
processing of the initial 45S RNA transcript to form the mature 28S, 18S,
and 5.8S ribosomal RNAs.
More recently, however, it has become clear that protein-coding genes,
which are being transcribed by RNA polymerase II, are also located in specific parts of the nucleus. Specific antibodies have been used to characterize the cellular distribution of RNA polymerase II phosphorylated on serine
5 in the C-terminal domain of the RPB1 subunit, since this is the form of the
polymerase that initiates transcription (see above). When this is done, it is
found that the phosphorylated form of the polymerase is not evenly distributed in the nucleus but has a punctate distribution, being highly enriched
in a number of discrete areas of the nucleus (Figure 4.24a). These areas
also contain newly transcribed RNA, indicating that they are sites where
specific genes are being actively transcribed and they are hence referred to
as “transcription factories” (Figure 4.24). Such transcription factories have
now been detected in live cells as well as those that have been artificially
fixed for examination, indicating that their appearance is not an artifact of
particular fixation techniques.
Interestingly, it appears that genes move into transcription factories
when they become active but are not associated with the factories when
they are inactive. Individual genes therefore move in and out of transcription factories depending on whether they are being transcribed or not
(Figure 4.25).
Moreover, it is clear that an individual transcription factory can contain genes with similar patterns of expression but which are located on

different chromosomes (Figures 4.24 and 4.25). This can be demonstrated
by showing that nascent transcripts from genes on different chromosomes
are found in the same transcription factory as illustrated in Figure 4.24b.
Indeed, it has been demonstrated that disrupting the long-range interactions of co-regulated genes disrupts their pattern of gene expression, indicating the importance of such interactions in gene regulation.
The close associations between genes on different chromosomes but
with similar expression patterns can readily be detected by the 3C technique, which uses formaldehyde treatment to cross-link pieces of DNA
that are in close contact in intact cells (see Chapter 2, Section 2.5, Methods
Box 2.2 for description of this technique). Thus, as well as being able to
detect looping of the DNA on an individual chromosome (Figure 4.26a)
(see also Chapter 2, Section 2.5, Figure 2.46), this technique can also
cross-link the DNA of different chromosomes that are in close proximity in
the cell (Figure 4.26b).
It is clear therefore that transcription occurs at particular regions within
the nucleus and that specific genes move to these regions and form or break
associations with other genes when they become transcriptionally active.
Moreover, regions of DNA that are not transcribed are also located in specific nuclear regions, distinct from the location of transcribed genes. For
example, the tightly packed nontranscribed DNA which is known as heterochromatin (see Chapter 2, Section 2.5) is located in specific regions adjacent
to the nucleolus and at the nuclear envelope, which separates the nucleus
from the cytoplasm (Figure 4.23).

the transcription factories. This can involve co-regulated genes
that are located on different chromosomes (genes 1, 2, and 3 on
chromosomes A, B, and c, respectively) becoming associated.

The 3c technique for cross-linking adjacent

4.2 TRANSCRIPTIONAL ELONgATION AND
TERMINATION
Transcriptional elongation requires further phosphorylation
of RNA polymerase II
As discussed in Section 4.1, phosphorylation of serine 5 within the C-terminal
repeat region the largest subunit of RNA polymerase II results in the
polymerase beginning transcription of the gene. The first nucleotide in the
DNA template that is copied into RNA (the +1 nucleotide) is usually a C or T
residue, resulting in the RNA beginning with the complementary nucleotide,
i.e. either a G or an A. Subsequently, transcription proceeds with the nucleotide complementary to the nucleotide in the DNA template strand being
inserted into the RNA, i.e. C in the DNA directs insertion of G in the RNA and
vice versa and T in the DNA directs insertion of A, while A in the DNA directs
insertion of U (which replaces T in the RNA). The nucleotides in the RNA
chain are joined to one another by phosphodiester bonds between the
carbon at the 3′ position on the ribose sugar of the upstream nucleotide and
the carbon at the 5′ position of the downstream nucleotide (Figure 4.27).

Chapter 4: The Process of Transcription
FIgURE 4.28
Recruitment of TFIIh results in the phosphorylation of RNA polymerase
II on serine 5 of the repeated sequence in the c-terminal domain of its
RPB1 subunit and allows transcriptional initiation to occur. however,
the polymerase pauses and ceases transcribing after producing a short
RNA transcript. Subsequently, recruitment of the pTeF-b kinase results
in the phosphorylation of the RPB1 subunit of polymerase II on serine 2
of the c-terminal domain, allowing transcriptional elongation to produce
the complete RNA product.

Hence, the first nucleotide in the chain has a free 5′ end and the RNA chain
grows in the 5′ to 3′ direction.
Initially it was thought that once transcription was initiated, the polymerase would transcribe the entire gene without further regulatory
processes being required. It is now clear however, that following transcriptional initiation, transcription proceeds for only approximately 20–30 bases
and the polymerase then pauses and does not continue transcribing. Release
of this block and continued transcriptional elongation requires phosphorylation of the C-terminal repeat region of the RPB1 subunit of RNA polymerase II on serine 2 of the Tyr-Ser-Pro-Thr-Ser-Pro-Ser repeated sequence
(Figure 4.28).
This phosphorylation of serine 2 is closely linked to the modification of
the free 5′ end of the nascent RNA transcript by addition of a modified G
nucleotide in a process known as capping (see Chapter 6, Section 6.1). This
capping process occurs when the RNA transcript is 20–30 bases long and
promotes the binding of the pTEF-b kinase protein. The pTEF-b kinase then
phosphorylates the C-terminal repeat of RNA polymerase II on serine 2,
allowing transcriptional elongation to occur (Figure 4.28). The linkage
between transcription and post-transcriptional processes such as capping is
discussed further in Chapter 6 (Section 6.4).

Polymerase pausing is widespread and represents a potential
control point for the regulation of transcription
It has been shown that in many genes, the polymerase may pause for an
extended period after transcribing 20–30 nucleotides and only then continue transcribing the gene. For example in Drosophila embryos approximately 1000 different genes were found to have paused polymerases which
had initiated transcription but had not extended the transcript beyond 20–30
nucleotides.
Such studies in both Drosophila and humans identified three classes of
genes in terms of RNA polymerase II distribution. Transcriptionally inactive
genes lacked polymerase while actively transcribed genes had polymerase
molecules distributed over their entire length, with slight peaks near the 5′
and 3′ ends of the gene. Most importantly, however, a third class of potentially active genes had a peak of paused polymerases near the 5′ end of the
gene (Figure 4.29).
Clearly, such polymerase pausing offers considerable opportunity for
gene regulation, with transcription being initiated and pausing before the
appearance of an activating signal which then releases the paused polymerase, so allowing production of the full protein-coding transcript
(Figure 4.30). The regulation of transcriptional elongation in this manner
is discussed further in Chapter 5 (Section 5.4).
Following the phosphorylation of serine 2 on the stalled polymerase by
pTEF-b, transcriptional elongation will occur with the polymerase moving
down the gene producing the RNA transcript. As noted above and in Chapter
3 (Section 3.5), loss of nucleosomes occurs at sites of transcriptional initiation facilitating access for regulatory factors and the RNA polymerase itself.
However, this is not the case for the remainder of the gene, so the elongating
RNA polymerase must transcribe through nucleosome-packaged DNA.
This appears to be achieved by the elongating polymerase recruiting
histone acetyltransferases, which acetylate the histone molecules on

nucleosomes in front of the elongating polymerase. This not only opens
the chromatin structure (see Chapter 3, Section 3.3) but actually displaces
the nucleosomes from the DNA. The free histones then associate with
other proteins, such as the FACT protein (see Chapter 3, Section 3.3).
These proteins catalyze reassembly of the nucleosome behind the elongating polymerase, which is followed by deacetylation of the histones
(Figure 4.31).

Termination of transcription occurs downstream of the
polyadenylation signal
Clearly the process of transcriptional elongation must eventually end, producing a transcript with a 3′ as well as a 5′ end. In the mature mRNA, the 3′
end is defined by the addition post-transcriptionally of a run of adenosine
nucleotides to produce a poly(A) tail in a process known as polyadenylation.
As discussed in Chapter 6 (Section 6.2), this process involves the recognition of a polyadenylation signal including the essentially invariant
sequence AAUAAA within the RNA followed by internal cleavage of the
RNA downstream of this sequence and polyadenylation of the free 3′ end.
Hence, the 3′ end of the mature transcript is upstream of the point at which
the initial transcript terminates (Figure 4.32).
Despite this however, the polyadenylation signal is also involved in the
process of transcriptional termination since mutation of this sequence interferes with normal termination. It is likely that polyadenylation facilitates termination in several ways. First, the cleavage/polyadenylation protein

complex which binds to the transcribing RNA polymerase (Figure 4.33a) (see
Chapter 6, Section 6.4) recruits the Rat 1 exonuclease enzyme (Figure 4.33b).
Cleavage of the RNA by the cleavage/polyadenylation complex not only produces the mature RNA transcript but also a downstream RNA with a free 5′
end that continues to be extended by the RNA polymerase (Figure 4.33c).
The Rat 1 exonuclease binds to this free 5′ end and progressively degrades the
RNA from its free 5′ end (Figure 4.33d). Ultimately the Rat 1 exonuclease
catches up with the polymerase and effectively “torpedoes” it, resulting in the
termination of transcription (Figure 4.33e).
Interestingly, the binding of the cleavage/polyadenylation complex
appears to slow the rate of transcription by the polymerase and make it
pause more frequently, so allowing Rat 1 to “catch up” with the polymerase
more rapidly.
Hence, the link between cleavage/polyadenylation and transcriptional termination is explained by three mechanisms, namely the recruitment of Rat 1 by the cleavage/polyadenylation complex, the slowing of

Recently, the 3C technique for detecting DNA looping (see Chapter 2,
Section 2.5 and this chapter, Section 4.1) has been used to show that the
DNA being transcribed frequently adopts a looped configuration in which
the sites of transcriptional initiation and termination are located close to
one another. This is likely to facilitate RNA polymerase moving from the site
of transcriptional termination back to the site of transcriptional initiation,
allowing a new round of transcription to occur (Figure 4.34).
When taken together with the studies discussed in Section 4.1, the studies of transcriptional elongation and termination discussed in this section
indicate that transcription involves multiple stages, namely initiation, pausing after transcription of a short region, active elongation, and termination
(Figure 4.35).

4.3 ThE gENE PROMOTER
As discussed in Section 4.1, sequences around or just upstream of the transcriptional start site play a critical role in the recruitment of RNA polymerase II to the genes which it transcribes. A number of genes transcribed by
RNA polymerase II contain a TATA box approximately 30 bases upstream of
the transcriptional start site. Other RNA polymerase II-transcribed genes utilize an initiator (Inr) sequence with the consensus 5′YCANTYY3′, with the A
residue being the first nucleotide that is transcribed. (Y is C or T and N is any
nucleotide.) This sequence is located around the transcriptional start site
and TBP is recruited to these promoters via binding of TAFs (TBP-associated
factors) (see Section 4.1).
Although a number of RNA polymerase II-transcribed genes contain
either a TATA box or an Inr sequence, a recent study mapping the location
of transcription initiation sites in the human genome indicated that the
majority of such sites contain both a TATA box-related sequence and an Inr
sequence, as well as the upstream and downstream TFIIB-binding sites
(BREs) that were discussed in Section 4.1 (Figure 4.36). A small number of
genes appear to lack both a TATA box and an Inr sequence. These genes
generally contain a CpG island (see Chapter 3, Section 3.2) close to the transcriptional start site and are transcribed at a low level in all cell types with
a variable start site of transcription.
The region around or just upstream of the transcriptional start site containing the TATA box and/or the Inr sequence (or the equivalent region in
genes where they are absent) as well as the BREs is known as the core or
basal promoter and serves to recruit the basal transcriptional complex, as
described in Section 4.1. The core promoter is defined as the minimal
region that can direct the initiation of transcription (Figure 4.36). However,
even when a TATA box and/or an Inr sequence are present, this produces
only a relatively low rate of transcription. This rate of transcription is
increased by the presence of upstream promoter elements, which as
their name indicates are located upstream of the core promoter. Together,
the core promoter and the upstream promoter elements constitute the promoter, which drives transcription of the gene (Figure 4.36).
It should be noted that production of the protein-coding RNA transcript
is unidirectional (Figure 4.36). However, in some cases, a noncoding RNA is
produced in the opposite direction to the protein-coding RNA transcript.
Hence, such bidirectional promoters are transcribed in both directions
and as discussed in Chapter 1, Section 1.5, the long noncoding RNAs produced in this way can play a key role in regulating the expression of the
protein-coding transcript (see Figures 1.45 and 1.46).

The 70 kDa heat-shock protein gene contains a typical promoter
for RNA polymerase II
To further illustrate the nature of RNA polymerase II promoters, we will
focus upon the gene encoding the 70 kDa molecular weight heat-shock
protein (HSP70). Exposure of a very wide variety of cells from different
organisms to elevated temperature results in the increased synthesis of a
few heat-shock proteins, of which HSP70 is the most abundant. Such
increased synthesis is mediated in part by increased transcription of the corresponding gene, which can be visualized as a puff within the polytene
chromosome of Drosophila (see Chapter 1, Section 1.4) As described below,
examination of the promoter sequences located upstream of the start site
for transcription of this gene allows us to identify potential upstream promoter sequences involved in its induction by temperature elevation, as well
as those involved in the general mechanism of transcription. The sequences
present in this region of the hsp70 gene which are also found in other genes
are listed in Table 4.2 and their arrangement is illustrated in Figure 4.37.
A study of this type reveals a number of sequence motifs including the
TATA box shared by the hsp70 gene promoter and other non-heat-inducible
genes, as well as one that is unique to heat-inducible genes. These will be
considered in turn.

The hsp70 gene promoter contains several DNA sequence motifs
which are found in a variety of other gene promoters
As discussed in Section 4.1, recruitment of the basal transcriptional complex containing TFIID, RNA polymerase II, and other associated factors via
initial binding of TBP to the TATA box can produce only a low rate of transcription. This rate is enhanced by the binding of other transcription factors
to sites upstream of the TATA box. These factors enhance either the stability
or the activity of the basal complex. The binding sites for several of these

Chapter 4: The Process of Transcription

factors are present in a wide variety of different genes with different patterns
of activity. These sites act as targets for the binding of specific factors which
are active in all cell types and their binding therefore results in increased
transcription in all tissues. The presence or absence of these sequences and
their number will determine the transcription rate of a particular gene in the
absence of any specific inducing stimulus.
An example of such a sequence is the Spl box, two copies of which are
present in the hsp70 gene promoter (Figure 4.37). This GC-rich DNA
sequence binds a transcription factor known as Spl which is present in all
cell types. Similarly, the CCAAT box is located upstream of the start site of
transcription of a wide variety of genes (including the hsp70 gene) that are
regulated in different ways and is believed to play an important role in
allowing transcription of the genes containing it by binding constitutively
expressed transcription factors, such as CTF (CAAT transcription factor).

The heat-shock element is found only in heat-inducible genes
In contrast to these very widespread sequence motifs, another sequence
element in the hsp70 gene promoter is shared only with other genes whose
transcription is increased in response to elevated temperature or other
forms of stress. This sequence is found 62 bases upstream of the start site
for transcription of the Drosophila hsp70 gene and at a similar position in
other heat-inducible genes. This heat-shock element (HSE) is therefore
believed to play a critical role in mediating the observed heat inducibility of
transcription of these genes.
To confirm that this is the case, it is necessary to utilize DNA constructs that contain a reporter gene encoding a protein whose amount
can be readily quantified (such as the enzymes β-galactosidase, chloramphenicol acetyl transferase, luciferase or thymidine kinase). The putative
regulatory sequence whose activity is being tested is linked to the reporter
gene and introduced into cells so that the effect of the regulatory sequence
on production of the protein encoded by the reporter gene can be measured. This can involve linking an entire promoter to the reporter gene
(Figure 4.38a). Alternatively, as in the case of the HSE, the effect of
a short DNA sequence on the activity of a control promoter linked to the
reporter gene can be measured (Figure 4.38b). In addition, the effect
of more distant regulatory sequences, such as enhancers (see Section
4.4) on a control promoter can also be investigated using this method
(Figure 4.38c).
This approach was used to investigate the role of the HSE in the heat
inducibility of the genes containing it. The HSE was transferred from the
hsp70 gene to the promoter and protein-coding sequence of the non-heatinducible thymidine kinase (tk) gene taken from the eukaryotic virus, herpes
simplex. When the hybrid reporter gene was introduced into cells and the
temperature subsequently raised, increased thymidine kinase production
was detected showing that the HSE had rendered the tk reporter gene inducible by elevated temperature (Figure 4.39).

This experiment therefore proves that the common sequence element
found in the heat-inducible genes is responsible directly for their heat inducibility. The manner in which these experiments were carried out also permits a further conclusion with regard to the way in which this sequence
acts. Thus, the HSE was taken from the Drosophila hsp70 gene and in this
cold-blooded organism would be activated normally by the thermally stressful temperature of 37°C. The cells into which the hybrid gene was introduced however, were mammalian cells which grow normally at 37°C and
only express the heat-shock genes at the higher temperature of 42°C.
In these experiments, the hybrid gene was induced only at 42°C, the
heat-shock temperature at which heat-shock genes are induced in the
mammalian cell into which it was introduced. It was not induced at 37°C,
the temperature at which heat-shock genes are induced in Drosophila from
which the DNA sequence came. This means that the HSE does not possess
some form of inherent temperature sensor or thermostat that is set to go off
at a particular temperature, since in this case the Drosophila sequence
would activate transcription at 37°C even in mammalian cells. Rather, it
must act by being recognized by a cellular protein that is activated in
response to elevated temperature and, by binding to the HSE, produces
increased transcription. Evidently, although the elements of this response
are conserved sufficiently to allow the mammalian protein to recognize
the Drosophila sequence, the mammalian protein will only be activated at
the mammalian heat-shock temperature and hence induction will only
occur at 42°C.
These experiments not only provide evidence for the importance of the
HSE in causing heat-inducible transcription but also indicate that it acts by
binding a protein. This indirect evidence that the HSE acts by binding a protein can be confirmed directly by using a variety of techniques that allow the
proteins binding to a specific DNA sequence to be analyzed (see below for
a description of some of these methods). When an analysis of this type is
carried out on the upstream regions of the heat-shock genes, it can be
shown that in non-heat-shocked cells TBP is bound to the TATA box and a
transcription factor known as the GAGA factor is bound to an upstream
GA-rich sequence (Figure 4.40a). The binding of the GAGA factor is

believed to displace a nucleosome and create the DNaseI hypersensitive
sites observed in these genes in non-heat-shocked cells (see Chapter 3,
Section 3.5). By contrast, in heat-shocked cells where high-level transcription of the gene is occurring, an additional protein which is bound to the
HSE is detectable on the upstream region (Figure 4.40b).
Hence the induction of the heat-shock genes is indeed accompanied by
the binding of a protein known as the heat-shock factor (HSF) to the HSE as
suggested by the experiments described above. The binding of this factor to
a gene whose chromatin structure has already been altered to render it
potentially activatable results in stimulation of transcription exactly as discussed in Chapter 3 and illustrated in Figure 3.55. In agreement with this,
the purified HSF can bind to the HSE and stimulate the transcription of the
hsp70 gene in a cell-free nuclear extract while having no effect on the transcription of the non-heat-inducible actin gene. The manner in which HSF is
activated in response to elevated temperature and then activates transcription of genes with an HSE is described in Chapter 8 (Section 8.1).

Other response elements are found in the promoters of genes
with different patterns of expression
An analysis of the hsp70 promoter identifies a number of sequences such as
the TATA box and the Spl and CCAAT boxes which are shared with a number of genes with different patterns of expression. These sequences play a
role in the general process of transcription. It also identifies the HSE as an
element which is shared only with other heat-inducible genes and which
plays a key role in their inducibility.
A number of similar elements have now been identified in the promoters
of genes activated by other signals. These sequences were originally identified by comparison of several different genes that are activated by the same
stimulus. More recently, genome-wide projects, such as the ENCODE project in the human genome (see below and Chapter 1, Section 1.4) have
begun to fully map the distribution of such regulatory sequences in the
entire genome. In many cases, the identification of such sequences has been
followed up by functional analysis showing that they are capable of transferring the specific response to another marker gene. A selection of such
sequences is listed in Table 4.3.
As indicated in Table 4.3, these sequences act by binding specific
proteins which are synthesized or activated in response to the inducing
signal. Such transcription factors are discussed further in Chapter 5. It is
noteworthy, however, that many of the sequences in Table 4.3 exhibit
dyad symmetry, a similar sequence being found in the 5′ to 3′ direction on
each strand. The estrogen response element (ERE) for example, has the
sequence:

transcription factors indicates that they bind to the site in a dimeric form
consisting of two protein molecules.
Various sequences that confer response to several different signals have
therefore been identified. One gene can possess more than one such element, allowing multiple patterns of regulation. Thus comparison of the
sequences listed in Table 4.3 with those contained in the hsp70 gene listed
in Table 4.2 reveals that in addition to the HSE this gene also contains the
cyclic AMP response element (CRE) which mediates the induction of a
number of genes, such as that encoding somatostatin, as well as the hsp70
gene in response to treatment with cyclic AMP.
Similarly, flexibility is provided by the presence of other regulatory elements in one gene and not another. This allows the induction of a particular
gene in response to a given stimulus which has no effect on another gene.
For example, although the hsp70 gene and the metallothionein IIA gene
share a binding site for the transcription factor AP2, only the metallothionein
gene has a binding site for the glucocorticoid receptor which confers
responsiveness to glucocorticoid hormone induction. Hence only this gene
is inducible by hormone treatment. The overall pattern of sequences present will control the basal expression of an individual gene and whether or
not it responds to particular stimuli.
In some cases, the sequence elements that confer responsiveness to a
particular stimulus can be shown to be related to one another. For example,
the sequence mediating the response to glucocorticoid treatment is similar
to that which mediates response to another steroid, namely estrogen.
Similarly, both the estrogen and thyroid hormone response elements contain identical sequences showing dyad symmetry forming a palindromic
repeat of the sequence GGTCA. In the ERE, however, the two halves of this
dyad symmetry are separated by three nucleotides which vary between

different genes, whereas in the thyroid hormone response element the two
halves are contiguous (Table 4.4a).
In addition, as well as being arranged as palindromic repeats, the GGTCA
core sequence can also be arranged as two direct repeats (Table 4.4b). In
this arrangement, the spacing between the two repeats can again regulate
which hormone produces a response. Thus, a spacing of four nucleotides
forms an alternative thyroid hormone response element, whereas a spacing
of one nucleotide confers responsiveness to 9-cis retinoic acid, a two or five
nucleotide space to all trans-retinoic acid, and a spacing of three nucleotides to vitamin D (Table 4.4b).
Such similarities in these different hormone response elements are paralleled by a similarity in the individual nuclear receptor proteins that form a
complex with each of these hormones and then bind to the corresponding
DNA sequence. All of these receptors can be shown to be members of a large
family of related DNA-binding proteins whose hormone and DNA-binding
specificities differ from one another. Hence a particular DNA sequence confers a response to a particular hormone because it binds the appropriate
receptor which also binds that hormone. The exchange of particular regions
of these receptor proteins with those of other family members has provided
considerable information on the manner in which sequence-specific binding
to DNA occurs and this is discussed in Chapter 5 (Section 5.1).
Although the sequence elements shown in Table 4.3 are all involved in the
response to particular inducers of gene expression, it is clear that other short
sequence elements or combinations of elements are involved in controlling
the tissue-specific patterns of expression exhibited by eukaryotic genes. For
example, the octamer motif (ATGCAAAT), which is found in both the immunoglobulin heavy- and light-chain promoters can confer B-cell-specific
expression when linked to a non-regulated promoter. Similarly, short DNA
sequences that bind liver-specific transcription factors have been identified in
the region of the rat albumin promoter, known to be involved in mediating the
liver-specific expression of this gene (see Chapter 10 for further discussion of
the mechanisms controlling cell type-specific gene transcription).

The proteins binding to short DNA sequence elements can
be characterized by a variety of techniques
In discussing short DNA sequence elements which either enhance transcription in all situations or which confer a particular pattern of gene
regulation we have assumed that they act by binding specific regulatory

factors binding to a radioactively labeled oligonucleotide
(*) while panel b shows what will be seen when the gel is
visualized by autoradiography. In track A, a protein (X) in the

radioactive complex of lower mobility. In track B, the cell

retarded complex forms. In track c, a large excess of unlabeled

proteins. As discussed above, initial studies provided indirect evidence
that this is the case for the HSE. However, it is necessary to prove directly
that this is so for the HSE and other short DNA sequences. A variety of
methods have therefore been devised for demonstrating that regulatory
protein(s) bind to a particular DNA sequence and for characterizing these
factors. Three of the most important of these will be described in turn.

(a) The DNA mobility shift assay
When a particular DNA sequence is first identified as a potential transcriptional regulatory element, the next step is usually to carry out a DNA electrophoretic mobility shift assay. In this technique, the DNA sequence (which
is radioactively labeled) and a cell extract are mixed. Protein binding to the
DNA is detected by the DNA moving more slowly in gel electrophoresis.
Hence, protein binding to DNA results in the appearance of a retarded band
which will be absent if no protein in the test extract can bind to the DNA
sequence. This gives the technique its alternative names of band shift or gel
retardation assay (Figure 4.41, track A) (Methods Box 4.1).
Once such a band has been detected, one can for example, carry out the
assay using extracts of different cell types or of cells treated in different
ways to see if the presence or absence of the DNA-binding activity correlates with the pattern of gene activity conferred by the DNA sequence
(Figure 4.41, tracks A and B). Similarly, it is possible to characterize the
DNA-binding specificity of the binding factor by adding a large excess of
unlabeled DNA sequences as well as the radioactively labeled sequence. If
the unlabeled “competitor” sequence can also bind the factor, it will do so
and since it is in excess it will prevent the labeled sequence from binding
the factor. However, since the competitor DNA is unlabeled, no radioactive
band will be detected (Figure 4.41, track C).
This method can therefore be used to determine whether a novel
DNA-binding activity has a similar binding specificity to a known DNAbinding protein and is therefore likely to be identical or closely related to
it. This relationship between the binding activity and known proteins can
also be probed if an antibody to the known protein is available. Thus, the

that binds to the test sequence, which is

fragments corresponding to digestion in this
region will not be formed and will appear as
a “footprint” in the ladder of bands formed
by DNaseI digestion at other, unprotected,
parts of the DNA. hence, protein binding
to specific sequences can be detected and
localized as a footprint.

antibody can be added to the assay to see whether it binds to the DNAbinding factor to form a complex of even lower mobility, which is known
as a “super-shifted” complex (Figure 4.41, track D).

(b)

DNaseI footprinting assay

The DNA mobility shift assay is of great value in characterizing the proteins binding to a specific DNA sequence. However, it does not provide any
information as to where the protein binds within the DNA sequence or its
position relative to other proteins binding to adjacent DNA sequences in the
regulatory region of a particular gene. This is achieved by the DNaseI footprinting assay in which binding of a protein protects its binding site in the
DNA from digestion (Figure 4.42) (Methods Box 4.2).
Although technically more difficult to carry out, this method offers
advantages over the DNA mobility shift assay. First, it delineates the nucleotides that are actually bound by the binding protein. Secondly, it is possible to visualize multiple footprints on a single DNA molecule, thereby

THE GENE PROMOTER
­

As with the DNA mobility shift assay, it is also possible to determine
whether a particular binding activity/footprint is observed with extracts
prepared from cells exposed to different treatments or from different cell
types and relate this to the pattern of expression of the gene being studied.
Similarly, the DNA sequence specificity of any binding activity can be studied by adding an excess of an unlabeled oligonucleotide containing a
sequence related to that of a particular footprint. If the DNA-binding activity producing the footprint can bind to the unlabeled sequence, it will do
so and hence the footprint will disappear since that region of DNA will no
longer be protected from digestion. DNaseI footprinting is therefore a valuable technique for examining the interaction of proteins with particular
DNA sequences.

(c) Chromatin immunoprecipitation
Both DNA mobility shift assays and DNaseI footprinting are normally carried
out using purified DNA fragments and cell extracts. They therefore demonstrate what proteins can bind to a DNA sequence, rather than determine
which proteins actually do so in the intact cell.
Recently, however, methods have been devised for carrying out largescale DNaseI footprinting in intact cells, so allowing a large number of binding sites for a specific factor to be characterized in one experiment. Where
an antibody to a particular transcription factor is available, however, it is
more usual to examine transcription factor binding in intact cells by using
the technique of chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP). In this technique,
an antibody to a particular transcription factor is used to immunoprecipitate
and purify the DNA fragments to which it is bound within the normal chromatin structure of a cell (Methods Box 4.3, Figure 4.43).
Using this method, it is possible to identify whether a particular gene of
interest is present in the immunoprecipitate under particular conditions,
thereby testing whether the transcription factor is bound to the gene in
intact cells under those conditions (Figure 4.44a). Hence, the effect of specific treatments such as heat shock, steroids, etc., on the binding of a particular factor to a specific DNA-binding site within the natural chromatin
structure of the gene can be investigated under different conditions.
In addition however, the ChIP technique can be used in conjunction with
DNA arrays or gene chips (see Chapter 1, Section 1.2) in which all the DNA
in a particular genome is arrayed on a glass slide. By labeling the immunoprecipitated DNA and hybridizing it to such a filter, all the target genes in
the cell for a particular factor can be characterized. This is referred to as
ChIP-chip analysis (Figure 4.44b).
Similarly, the development of high-throughput DNA sequencing techniques renders it possible to obtain the actual DNA sequence of all the binding sites for the factor in a specific cell type. This is referred to as ChIP-seq
analysis (Figure 4.44c).

ChIP-seq

The use of high-throughput methods such ChIP-chip and
ChIP-seq allows the analysis of DNA-binding sites and
epigenetic modifications on a whole genome basis
This genome-wide location analysis, which combines ChIP assays with
DNA arrays (ChIP-chip) or with DNA sequence analysis (ChIP-seq) has
become of enormous importance as the genomes of more and more organisms are sequenced. Thus in yeast, a number of putative regulatory DNA
sequences have been identified on the basis of their sequence and their
conservation between different yeast strains. By using genome-wide location analysis, such sequences can be tested for their ability to bind specific
transcription factors under different conditions. Hence, all the binding sites
for a particular factor in the yeast genome can be defined and the effect on
such binding of specific treatments can be assessed.
In this way, it is possible to begin to characterize the complex regulatory networks that are characteristic of eukaryotes in which transcription
factors evidently bind at large numbers of different sites across the
genome. Indeed, a study using genome-wide location analysis showed
that the yeast Ste12 transcription factor binds to distinct binding sites and
therefore regulates distinct sets of genes during mating compared with
filamentous growth.
A similar approach aimed at identifying all the regulatory elements in
the human genome and defining the factors which bind to them has now
been carried out by the ENCODE Project Consortium (see Chapter 1, Section
1.4). Although such an analysis is obviously much more complex in humans
compared with the less complex yeast, they have succeeded in using ChIPseq analysis to characterize the binding sites for 119 transcription factors
across the entire human genome and similar analyses have also been conducted in mice and Drosophila.
However, the use of ChIP in gene control studies is not confined to mapping the distribution of transcription factors (Figure 4.45a). Indeed it can
be used in any situation where an antibody with a particular specificity is
available. For example, as discussed in Chapter 3 (Section 3.3) by using an
antibody specific for methylated C residues, ChIP can be used to identify the
distribution of this modification in an individual gene or throughout the
genome, if used in conjunction with DNA arrays or high-throughput DNA
sequencing (Figure 4.45b). Hence, ChIP offers an important means of
mapping this modification which plays a key role in controlling chromatin
structure and therefore in gene control.

Similarly, in view of the importance of histone modifications in the regulation of chromatin structure (see Chapter 3, Section 3.3) ChIP analysis can
also be used to map the distribution of such modifications in cases where a
specific antibody is available (Figure 4.45c). For example, an antibody specific for histone H3 which is methylated on lysine 9 and one specific for
methylation of this histone on lysine 27 have been used to map the location
of these modifications and to further strengthen the evidence for their association with a tightly packed chromatin structure.
The availability of high-throughput methods such as ChIP-seq has also
facilitated comparison of DNA-binding sites between different species and
between different individuals of the same species. In general, such studies
indicate relatively rapid evolutionary change in such sequences between species with around 30–40% of transcription factor-binding sites in humans not
being fully conserved in rodents. Similarly, different human individuals differ
in their binding sites for specific transcription factors with, for example, 7.5%
of binding sites for the NFκB transcription factor varying between different
human individuals. These alterations in the DNA sequence of specific binding
sites are likely to produce differences in the binding of the corresponding
transcription factors and therefore in the level of expression of specific target
genes. They are likely to contribute therefore to the phenotypic differences
between different individuals of the same species, as well as to the much
greater differences in gene expression between different species.

Promoter regulatory elements act by binding factors
which either affect chromatin structure and/or influence
transcription directly
It is clear, therefore, that short DNA sequence elements located near the
start site of transcription play an important role in controlling gene
expression in eukaryotes. As indicated in Table 4.3 and discussed above,
such sequences mediate transcriptional activation by binding a specific
protein. This binding may give rise to gene activity in one of two ways
(Figure 4.46).
First, as discussed in Chapter 3 (Section 3.5) and illustrated by the glucocorticoid receptor, binding of a specific protein may result in displacement of
a nucleosome and generation of a DNaseI hypersensitive site, allowing easy
access to the gene for other transcription factors (Figure 4.46a). The direct
activation of transcription by DNA-binding proteins constitutes the second
mechanism of gene induction, and is illustrated by the binding of the HSF to
its consensus sequence in the heat-inducible genes (Figure 4.46b).
These factors are likely to act by interacting with proteins necessary for transcription, such as TFIID, TFIIB or RNA polymerase itself. This interaction
facilitates the formation of a stable transcription complex, which may
enhance the binding of RNA polymerase to the DNA or alter its structure in
a manner that increases its activity (for further discussion see Chapter 5,
Section 5.2).

145

FIgURE 4.45
As well as being used to map the binding
of a transcription factor to an individual
gene or across the genome (a), chromatin
immunoprecipitation (chIP) analysis can
also be used with an antibody specific to
methylated c residues (b), or one specific
to a specific histone (h) modification (c), to
map these features at the level of a specific
gene or across the entire genome. The pink
symbols show the antibody in each case.

It should be noted that these two mechanisms of action are not exclusive.
Thus the glucocorticoid receptor whose binding to a specific DNA sequence
displaces a nucleosome also contains an activation domain capable of
interacting with other DNA-bound transcription factors (see Chapter 5,
Section 5.2). Hence, following binding of the receptor, transcription is
increased by interactions between the receptor and other bound factors.
Similarly, the HSF can induce the acetylation of histone H4 which results in
a more open chromatin structure (see Chapter 3, Section 3.3), indicating that
it can modulate chromatin structure, as well as stimulating the basal transcriptional complex. Hence, the binding of transcription factors to short DNA
sequence elements can activate transcription by two distinct mechanisms,
with at least some factors utilizing both of these mechanisms.
Short DNA sequence elements located in the promoter region close to
the start site of transcription therefore play a critical role in activating
gene transcription. However, important elements involved in the regulation of eukaryotic gene expression are also found at greater distances
from the site of initiation of transcription and these elements will be discussed in the next section.

4.4 ENhANCERS AND SILENCERS
Enhancers are regulatory sequences that act at a distance
to increase gene expression
The first indication that sequences located at a distance from the start site of
transcription might influence gene expression in eukaryotes came with the
demonstration that sequences over 100 bases upstream of the transcriptional start site of the histone H2A gene were essential for its high-level
transcription. Moreover, although this sequence was unable to act as a
promoter and direct transcription, it could increase initiation from an

Subsequently, a vast range of similar elements has been described in
both cellular genes and those of eukaryotic viruses. They have been called
enhancers because although they lack promoter activity and are unable to
direct transcription themselves, they can dramatically enhance the activity
of promoters. Hence, if an enhancer element is linked to a promoter, the
activity of the promoter can be increased several hundred-fold.
Variation in the position and orientation at which an enhancer element
was placed relative to the promoter has led to three conclusions with regard
to the action of enhancers. These are: (a) an enhancer element can activate
a promoter when placed up to several thousand bases from the promoter;
(b) an enhancer can activate a promoter when placed in either orientation
relative to the promoter; (c) an enhancer can activate a promoter when
placed upstream or downstream of the transcribed region, or within an
intervening sequence which is removed from the RNA by splicing (see
Chapter 6, Section 6.3). These characteristics constitute the definition of an
enhancer and are summarized in Figure 4.47. Hence, the typical eukaryotic gene will contain enhancer elements, as well as core and upstream
promoter elements (Figure 4.48).

Many enhancers have cell type- or tissue-specific activity
Although the first enhancers to be discussed were active in all cell types, it
was subsequently shown that many genes expressed in specific tissues also
contained enhancers. Such enhancers frequently exhibited a tissue-specific
activity. Thus, they are able to enhance the activity of a test promoterreporter gene construct (see Figure 4.38c) only in the tissue in which the
gene from which they were derived is normally active and not in other tissues (Figure 4.49). Therefore the tissue-specific activity of such enhancers
acting on their normal promoters is likely to play a critical role in mediating
the observed pattern of gene regulation.
For example, as previously discussed (Chapter 1, Section 1.3), the
genes encoding the heavy and light chains of the antibody molecule contain an enhancer located within the large intervening region separating
the regions encoding the joining and constant regions of these molecules.
When this element is linked to a control promoter-reporter gene construct
it increases promoter activity dramatically when the hybrid gene is introduced into B lymphocytes (which are the cells that make antibodies). In
contrast, however, no effect of the enhancer on promoter activity is
observed in other cell types, such as fibroblasts, indicating that the activity
of the enhancer is tissue specific.
Similarly, as discussed in Chapter 11 (Section 11.1), specific cancers
involve chromosomal rearrangements that link the immunoglobulin
enhancer with the gene encoding the c-Myc protein which regulates cellular growth. This results in enhanced expression of the c-myc gene producing B-cell cancers. This example illustrates the power of enhancer elements
to alter gene expression even when removed from their normal location by
a chromosomal translocation.
Similar tissue-specific enhancers have also been detected in genes
expressed specifically in the liver (α-fetoprotein, albumin, α-1-antitrypsin),
­
the endocrine and exocrine cells of the pancreas (insulin, elastase, amylase), the pituitary gland (prolactin, growth hormone), and many other tissues. The tissue-specific activity of these enhancer elements is likely to
play a crucial role in the observed tissue-specific pattern of expression of
the corresponding genes.
In the case of the insulin gene, early experiments involving linkage of
different upstream regions of the gene to a marker gene and subsequent
introduction into different cell types, identified a region approximately 250
bases upstream of the transcriptional start site as being of crucial importance in producing high-level expression in pancreatic endocrine cells. This
position corresponds exactly to the position of the tissue-specific enhancer,
indicating the importance of this element in pancreatic gene regulation.
Similarly, mutation of conserved sequences within the tissue-specific
enhancers of genes expressed in the exocrine cells of the pancreas, such as

elastase and chymotrypsin, abolishes the tissue-specific pattern of expression of these genes.
The importance of the insulin gene enhancer element in producing
tissue-specific gene expression was further demonstrated by experiments in
which this enhancer (together with its adjacent promoter) was linked to the
gene encoding the large T antigen of the eukaryotic virus SV40, acting as a
reporter gene in which production of the corresponding protein can be measured readily using a specific antibody. The resulting construct was introduced
into a fertilized mouse egg and the expression of large T antigen was analyzed
in all tissues of the transgenic mouse that developed from the egg. Expression
of large T antigen was detectable only in the pancreas and not in any other
tissue (Figure 4.50). Moreover, it was observed specifically in the β cells of
the pancreatic islets which produce insulin (Figure 4.51). The enhancer of
the insulin gene is therefore capable of conferring the specific pattern of insulin gene expression on an unrelated gene in vivo. Hence, this example also
illustrates how the reporter gene method can be used to assay the activity of
regulatory sequences in intact animals as well as in cultured cells.
Like promoter elements, enhancer elements therefore constitute another
type of DNA sequence that is involved in the transcription of some genes in
all cell types and in the activation of specific genes in a particular tissue or
in response to a particular stimulus. As with promoter elements, the binding

elements has been demonstrated for many different enhancers, including
those in the immunoglobulin and insulin genes. This has been achieved
using the techniques described in Section 4.3, which can be used to determine the protein(s) binding to any specific DNA sequence regardless of
whether it is located adjacent to the promoter or within an enhancer.
Therefore, in many cases the tissue-specific expression of a gene will be
determined both by the enhancer element and sequences adjacent to the
promoter. In the liver-specific pre-albumin gene for example, gene activity is
controlled both by the promoter itself which is active only in liver cells and
by an upstream enhancer element which activates any promoter approximately 10-fold in liver cells and not at all in other cell types. Similarly, in the
immunoglobulin genes when the enhancer and the promoter are analyzed
both exhibit B-cell-specific activity in isolation but the maximal expression
of the gene is observed only when the two elements are brought together.
The importance of enhancer elements in the regulation of gene expression therefore necessitates consideration of the mechanisms by which
they act.

Enhancers influence transcription both by recruiting
DNA-binding transcription factors and by altering
chromatin structure
In considering the nature of enhancers, we have drawn a distinction
between those elements which act at a distance and the sequences discussed in Section 4.3 which are located immediately adjacent to the start
site of transcription. In fact however, closer inspection of the sequences
within enhancers indicates that they are often composed of the same
sequences found adjacent to promoters.
For example, the immunoglobulin heavy-chain enhancers contain the
octamer motif (ATGCAAAT), which as discussed previously is also found in
the immunoglobulin gene promoters. Use of DNA mobility shift and DNaseI
footprinting assays (see Section 4.3) has shown that these promoter and
enhancer octamer elements bind the identical B-cell-specific transcription
factor (as well as a related protein found in all cell types) and play an important role in the B-cell-specific expression of the immunoglobulin heavychain gene. Interestingly, in the enhancer, the octamer motif is found within
a modular structure containing binding sites for several different transcription factors which act together to activate gene expression.
The close relationship of enhancer and promoter elements is further
illustrated by the Xenopus hsp70 gene, in which multiple copies of the HSE
are located at positions far upstream of the start site and function as a
heat-inducible enhancer element when transferred to another gene.
Similarly, the HSE of the Drosophila hsp70 gene which we have used as an
example of a promoter motif has been shown to function as a heat-inducible
enhancer when multiple copies are placed at a position well upstream of the
transcriptional start site of a test gene.
Enhancers therefore appear to consist of sequence motifs that can also
be present in similarly regulated promoters and may be present within the
enhancer in multiple copies or associated with other control elements. In
many cases, an enhancer will therefore consist of an array of different or
repeated sequence motifs which function together to produce strong activation of transcription. The array of different regulatory proteins that assemble
on such an enhancer has been called an enhanceosome.
It seems likely that individual enhancers may activate gene expression
by either or both of the mechanisms described previously for promoter
elements, namely by changing chromatin structure leading to nucleosome
displacement or by direct interaction with the proteins of the basal transcriptional apparatus. Indeed, the enhanceosome of the interferon-β gene
has been shown to function by both these mechanisms. Thus, an enhanceosome complex of regulatory proteins initially assembles on the enhancer.
This contains a total of eight different proteins including the DNA-binding
protein HMG1(Y) and several different transcriptional activators such as

 ENHANCERS AND SILENCERS

NFκB and c-Jun. In this complex, the eight proteins interact to form a continuous surface which binds to the DNA (Figure 4.52).
Subsequently, the enhanceosome complex first recruits a histone acetyltransferase complex stimulating the subsequent recruitment of the chromatin remodeling complex SWI/SNF. As described in Chapter 3 (Sections 3.3
and 3.5), this will open up the chromatin and allow the binding of the

Activation of the β-interferon promoter involves binding of the
enhanceosome complex to the enhancer. This facilitates the recruitment
of a histone acetyltransferase (hA) which in turn recruits the SWI/SNF
complex, leading to nucleosome displacement and binding of the basal
transcriptional complex.

Interestingly, acetylation of histones during the activation of the
β-interferon enhancer takes place in two stages, each of which has a different function. Acetylation of histone H4 on lysine 8 allows the recruitment of
the SWI/SNF complex, while subsequent acetylation of histone H3 on
lysines 9 and 14 results in the recruitment of TFIID.

The “at a distance” action of enhancers involves both
DNA-binding transcription factors and alteration of
chromatin structure
Evidently, the mechanisms of enhancer action discussed above must
explain how enhancers can stimulate the activity of a distant promoter.
In the case of changes in chromatin structure, it is readily apparent that
such changes caused by a protein binding to the enhancer could be propagated over large distances in both directions, resulting in the observed
distance, position, and orientation independence of the enhancer. In agreement with this possibility, DNaseI hypersensitive sites (indicating regions of
altered chromatin structure) have been mapped within a number of enhancer
elements, including the immunoglobulin light- and heavy-chain gene enhancers. Moreover, the nucleosome-free gap in the DNA of the eukaryotic virus
SV40 is located at the position of the enhancer (see Chapter 3, Section 3.5).

153

 ENHANCERS AND SILENCERS
At first sight, models involving the binding of protein factors in the
enhancer followed by direct interaction with proteins of the basal transcriptional apparatus are more difficult to reconcile with the action at a distance
characteristic of enhancers. Nonetheless, the binding to enhancers of very
many proteins crucial for transcriptional activation suggests that enhancers
can indeed function in this manner.
This problem is solved by findings which indicate that in many cases,
proteins bound at the enhancer interact directly with proteins bound at the
promoter via looping of the intervening DNA (Figure 4.54). This can explain
how DNA-binding proteins bound at a distant enhancer can influence the
activity of the basal transcriptional complex bound at a distant promoter.
Moreover, such a model can explain the critical importance of DNA
structure on the action of enhancers. Thus it has been shown that removal
of precise multiples of 10 nucleotides (one helical turn) from the region
between the SV40 enhancer and its promoter has no effect on enhancer
activity but deletion of DNA corresponding to half a helical turn disrupts
enhancer function severely.
Interestingly, some proteins that bind to enhancers actually bend the
DNA to facilitate interactions between regulatory proteins bound at distant
sites on the DNA (Figure 4.54). This is seen in the case of the T-cell receptor
α chain gene enhancer where the LEF-1 factor binds to a site at the center
of the enhancer and bends the DNA so that other regulatory transcription
factors can interact with one another.
Hence, regulatory proteins can bind at the enhancer and influence the
activity of the basal transcriptional complex via looping or bending of the
DNA. Indeed, a recent study using the 3C technique for detecting DNA looping (see Chapter 2, Methods Box 2.2) and this chapter, Section 4.1) identified
approximately 40,000 different long-range promoter–enhancer interactions
in mouse cells and showed that many of these were regulated in a cell
type-specific manner.
Interestingly, it has been shown that in some cases, DNA-binding activator proteins bound to the enhancer can actually recruit the basal transcriptional complex (consisting of RNA polymerase II, TFIID, TFIIB, etc.) to the
enhancer itself. This has been suggested to poise the gene ready for transcription. Subsequently, in response to an activation signal, the polymerase
complex is transferred to the promoter via DNA looping and transcription
begins (Figure 4.55). This effect has been demonstrated for the CD80 gene
which lacks both an initiator element and a TATA box (see Section 4.1).
Recruitment of the basal transcriptional complex via an enhancer may
therefore occur particularly in genes which lack the promoter elements that
would normally recruit the complex.

Many enhancers are transcribed to produce long

As well as binding a variety of regulatory proteins, a number of enhancers
are also transcribed to produce long noncoding RNAs (see Chapter 1,
Section 1.5 for discussion of these RNAs). In many cases the transcription
pattern of these RNAs occurs in situations where the enhancer is activated
and it is likely that in many cases, the regulatory RNA plays an important
role in stimulating enhancer activity.
As discussed in Chapter 1 (Section 1.5), regulatory RNAs frequently
recruit proteins that can alter chromatin structure. Hence, the transcription
of a long noncoding RNA could result in the recruitment of factors which

result in a more open chromatin structure of the enhancer, allowing the
binding of regulatory proteins which then stimulate promoter activity
(Figure 4.56a).
Interestingly, transcription of the enhancer to produce a long noncoding
RNA can also affect the chromatin structure at the promoter. This is likely to
involve DNA looping. This would lead to the long noncoding RNA which is
transcribed from the enhancer, coming into close contact with the promoter
and recruiting to it proteins that can alter the chromatin structure and enable transcription of the gene (Figure 4.56b).

Silencers can act at a distance to inhibit gene expression
Thus far we have assumed that enhancers act in an entirely positive
manner. In a tissue containing an active enhancer-binding protein, the
enhancer will activate a promoter whereas in other tissues where the protein
is absent or inactive, the enhancer will have no effect. Such a mechanism
does indeed appear to operate for the majority of enhancers which when
linked to promoters, activate gene expression in one or a few cell types and
have no effect in other cell types. In contrast however, some sequences
appear to act in an entirely negative manner, inhibiting the expression of
genes which contain them. Following the initial identification of such an
element in the cellular oncogene c-myc (see Chapter 11, Section 11.1),
similar elements, which are referred to as silencers, have been defined in
genes encoding proteins as diverse as collagen type II, growth hormone,
and glutathione transferase P. Like enhancers, silencers can act on distant
promoters when present in either orientation, but have an inhibitory rather
than a stimulatory effect on the level of gene expression.
As with enhancer elements it is likely that these silencers act either at
the level of chromatin structure, by recruiting factors which direct the tight
packing of adjacent DNA or by binding a protein which then directly inhibits
transcription by interacting with RNA polymerase and its associated factors.
Examples of silencers that appear to act in each of these ways have been
observed (Figure 4.57). For example, the silencer element located approximately 2 kb from the promoters of the repressed mating type loci in yeast
plays a crucial role in organizing this region into the tightly packed structure characteristic of nontranscribed DNA (see Chapter 10, Section 10.3 for
further discussion of the yeast mating type system).
Interestingly, the silencer element appears to represent a site for attachment of the DNA to the nuclear matrix. Hence, it may act by promoting the
further condensation of the 30 nm chromatin fiber to form a loop of DNA
attached to the nuclear matrix which is the most condensed structure of
chromatin (see Chapter 2, Section 2.5 and Figure 2.45).
This could be achieved by recruiting protein factors which direct tight
packing of the adjacent DNA, in the same way as the SWI/SNF complex
and the GAGA factor direct the unpacking of the adjacent DNA (see Chapter
3, Section 3.5). Indeed, as discussed in Chapter 3 (Section 3.3) specific factors such as polycomb have been identified which have exactly this effect,
inducing the ubiquitination of histone H2A and the methylation of histone
H3 on lysines 9 and 27, thereby promoting the tight packing of chromatin
(Figure 4.58). Moreover, inactivation of polycomb by mutation results in

Polycomb and trithorax proteins can bind to the same response

(b). The transition from polycomb to trithorax binding requires the
transcription of the PRe/TRe to produce a noncoding RNA.

aberrant activation of specific genes exactly as would be expected for a
protein which promotes an inactive chromatin structure (see Chapter 9,
Sections 9.1 and 9.2 for further discussion of the role of polycomb proteins
in development). Hence, chromatin structure is controlled by the antagonistic effects of proteins such as polycomb which direct tight packing of the
chromatin and others such as GAGA/trithorax and brahma (see Chapter 3,
Section 3.3) which direct its opening.
Interestingly, silencer elements that bind polycomb proteins can also
bind trithorax proteins. Hence, the same sequence can direct the production
of a closed or open chromatin structure depending on the protein complexes that bind under different conditions or in different cell types. These
DNA sequences are therefore known as polycomb response elements/trithorax response elements.
It has been shown that the transition from polycomb binding to trithorax
binding at these sequences can involve the transcription of noncoding RNAs
from the response element itself (Figure 4.59). Moreover, blocking the
synthesis of these noncoding RNAs prevents the transition to an open chromatin structure and transcriptional activation. These noncoding RNAs
therefore play a key role in gene activation, paralleling the role of such
RNAs in enhancer activity (see above).
As well as acting at the level of chromatin structure, it is also possible for
silencers to act by binding negatively acting transcription factors which
interact with the basal transcriptional complex of RNA polymerase II and
associated factors (Figure 4.57). For example, the silencer in the gene
encoding lysozyme appears to act at least in part by binding the thyroid
hormone receptor, which in the absence of thyroid hormone has a directly
inhibitory effect on gene activity (see Chapter 5, Section 5.3).
Hence, just as enhancer elements can act at a distance to enhance gene
expression by opening up the chromatin or by directly stimulating transcription, silencers can inhibit gene expression either by promoting a more
tightly packed chromatin structure or by directly repressing transcription.

CONCLUSIONS
In this chapter, we have discussed the process of transcription initiated by
the three nuclear RNA polymerases which are found in all eukaryotes, each
of which has a key role in the transcription of specific genes. Transcription

by the three RNA polymerases has a number of common features including
the presence of common subunits in the three polymerases, the role of prior
DNA binding by specific factors in recruiting the polymerase, and the key
role of TBP in this process.
Nonetheless, the process of transcription by RNA polymerase II is more
complex, paralleling its role in the transcription of protein coding genes
which exhibit highly complex patterns of regulated transcription. For example, the basal transcriptional complex for RNA polymerase II involves far
more factors than the complexes producing transcription by the other RNA
polymerases. Moreover, transcriptional elongation by RNA polymerase II is
a regulated process with the polymerase pausing 20–30 bases after transcriptional initiation and requiring further signals to proceed with transcriptional elongation.
Perhaps the greatest complexity in RNA polymerase II-mediated transcription is the array of DNA sequences, which control both constitutive and
regulated transcription (promoters, enhancers, silencers, etc.). Indeed, it has
been argued that such a complex pattern of sequences regulating a single
gene is one of the defining features of a eukaryotic protein-coding gene and
is necessary to produce the complex patterns of gene expression required in
the adult organism and in development.
The promoter, enhancer, and silencer sequences that we have discussed
in this chapter can act both by altering chromatin structure and by binding
regulatory proteins that interact with the basal transcriptional complex to
modify its activity. As such, they complement the actions of the locus control region (LCR) and insulator sequences which were discussed in Chapter
2 (Section 2.5) and which act at the level of chromatin structure. These
sequences act in the case of LCRs to control the chromatin structure of a
DNA region and in the case of insulators to prevent inappropriate spreading
of chromatin structure to an adjacent region. Indeed, insulators act in this
way to limit the spread of gene activation or repression not only by LCRs but
also by enhancers and silencers, which as described in Section 4.4 can activate or repress gene expression over long distances.
Hence, RNA polymerase II genes can be influenced by promoter,
enhancer, silencer, LCR, and insulator sequences (Figure 4.60). The combined action of such sequences will control the chromatin structure and
provide binding sites for transcription factors which can interact directly or
indirectly with the basal transcriptional complex to enhance or reduce its
transcription. The nature of these transcription factors and the manner in
which they control transcription is discussed in the next chapter.

Transcription Factors and
Transcriptional Control
INTRODUCTION
As discussed in Chapter 4, the expression of specific genes in particular cell
types or tissues is regulated by DNA sequence motifs present within promoter or enhancer elements. These elements control the alteration in chromatin structure of genes that occurs in a particular lineage, or the subsequent
induction of gene transcription. It was assumed for many years that such
sequences would act by binding regulatory proteins that were only synthesized in a particular tissue or were present in an active form only in that
tissue. In turn, the binding of these proteins would result in the observed
effect on gene expression. Indeed, as described in Chapter 4 (Section 4.3)
cell extracts can be used in DNA mobility shift or DNase I footprinting assays
to show that they contain protein(s) able to bind to a specific sequence.
The isolation and characterization of such proteins proved difficult however, principally because they were present in very small amounts. Hence,
even if they could be purified, the amounts obtained were too small to provide much information about the properties of the protein.
This obstacle was overcome by the cloning of the genes encoding a
number of different transcription factors. Two general approaches were
used to achieve this. In one approach (Figure 5.1), the transcription factor
Spl was purified by virtue of its ability to bind to its specific DNA-binding
site. The partial amino acid sequence of the protein was then obtained from
the small amount of material isolated and was used in conjunction with the
genetic code to predict a set of DNA oligonucleotides, one of which would
encode this region of the protein. The oligonucleotides were then hybridized to a complementary DNA library prepared from mRNA isolated from
Spl-containing HeLa cells. A cDNA clone derived from the Spl mRNA must
contain the sequence capable of encoding the protein and hence will
hybridize to the probe. In this experiment one single cDNA clone derived
from the Spl mRNA was isolated by screening a library of one million
recombinant cDNA clones prepared from the whole population of HeLa cell
mRNAs.
An alternative more direct approach to the cloning of transcription factors was used to clone the gene encoding the NFκB transcription factor,
which is involved in regulating the expression of the immunoglobulin genes
in B cells (Figure 5.2) (see Chapter 8, Section 8.2 for discussion of NFκB
and its regulation). As in the previous method, a cDNA library was constructed containing copies of all the mRNAs in a specific cell type, in this
case B lymphocytes. However, the library was constructed in such a way
that the sequences within it would be translated into their corresponding
proteins. This was achieved by inserting the cDNA into the coding region of
the β-galactosidase gene, resulting in the translation of the eukaryotic insert
as part of the β-galactosidase protein, producing a fusion protein.

Most interestingly, these fusion proteins were capable of binding DNA
with the same specificity as the original transcription factor encoded by the
cloned mRNA. The library could therefore be screened directly with a radiolabeled oligonucleotide containing the DNA-binding site for the particular
transcription factor of interest. A clone containing the cDNA for this factor
and hence expressing it as a fusion protein was able to bind the labeled
DNA and could therefore be identified and isolated.
Unlike the previous method, this procedure involves DNA–protein rather
than DNA–DNA binding and can be used without prior purification of the
transcription factor provided that its DNA-binding site is known. Since most
factors are identified on the basis of their binding to a particular DNA-binding
site, this is not a significant problem and the use of these two cloning methods has resulted in the isolation of the genes encoding a wide variety of
transcription factors.
In turn, this has resulted in an explosion of information on these factors.
Once the gene for a factor has been cloned, Southern blotting (Chapter 1,
Section 1.3) can be carried out to study the structure of the gene, Northern
blotting or other techniques for RNA analysis (Chapter 1, Section 1.2) can be
used to search for RNA transcripts derived from it in different cell types, and
related genes expressed in other tissues or other species can be identified.
More importantly, considerable information can be obtained from the
cloned gene about the corresponding protein and its activity. Not only can
the DNA sequence of the gene be used to predict the amino acid sequence
of the corresponding protein, but the existence of functional domains with

particular activities within the protein can also be defined. As described
above, if the gene encoding a transcription factor is expressed in bacteria, it
continues to bind DNA in a sequence-specific manner. Hence if the gene is
broken up into small pieces and each of these is expressed in bacteria
(Figure 5.3), the ability of each portion to bind to DNA, to other proteins or
to another potential regulatory molecule can be assessed using, for example, DNA mobility shift assays, exactly as with cellular extracts (see Chapter
4, Section 4.3). This mapping of the DNA-binding domain can also be
achieved by transcribing and translating pieces of the cloned DNA into protein fragments in the test tube and testing their ability to bind to a specific
DNA sequence in the same way.
Each of the domains of the transcription factor identified in this way can
be altered by mutagenesis of the corresponding DNA encoding that region of
the protein and subsequent expression of the mutant protein as before. The
testing of the effect of these mutations on the activity mediated by the particular domain of the protein will thus allow the identification of the amino
acids that are critical for each of the observed properties of the protein.
In this way large amounts of information have accumulated on individual transcription factors. Rather than attempt to consider each factor individually, we will focus on the properties necessary for such a factor and
illustrate our discussion by referring to the manner in which these are
achieved in individual cases.
In this chapter, we will first consider in Section 5.1 the manner in which
transcription factors bind to DNA in a sequence-specific manner.
Subsequently, in Sections 5.2 and 5.3 we will consider the manner in which
the DNA-bound factors influence transcription initiation either positively or
negatively by interacting with other transcription factors or with the basal
transcriptional complex of RNA polymerase II and associated factors. Such
positive or negative effects can also occur at the level of transcriptional
elongation and this will therefore be considered in Section 5.4. The primary
focus of this chapter will be on transcription factors that regulate RNA polymerase II transcription, since this polymerase transcribes protein-coding
genes. However, Section 5.5 will consider transcriptional regulation of
genes transcribed by RNA polymerases I and III.

DNa BINDINg BY TRaNSCRIpTION FaCTORS

(a)

all

Extensive studies of eukaryotic transcription factors have identified several
structural elements which either bind directly to DNA or which facilitate
DNA binding by adjacent regions of the protein. These motifs will be discussed in turn, using examples of transcription factors that contain them to
illustrate their properties.

The helix-turn-helix motif is found in a number of transcription
factors which regulate gene expression during embryonic
development
The small size and rapid generation time of the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster
has led to it being one of the best characterized organisms genetically and
a number of mutations that affect various properties of the organism have
been described. These include mutations that affect the development of
the fly, resulting for example in the production of additional legs in the
usual position of the antennae (Figure 5.4). Genes of this type, known as
homeotic genes, are likely to play a crucial role in the development of the
fly and, in particular, in determining the body plan (see Chapter 9, Section
9.2 for further discussion of the role of homeotic genes in Drosophila
development).
The critical role for the products of these genes identified genetically,
suggested that they would encode regulatory proteins that would act at particular times in development to activate or repress the activity of other genes
encoding proteins required for the production of particular structures. This
idea was confirmed when the genes encoding these proteins were cloned.
Thus, these proteins were shown to be able to bind to DNA in a sequencespecific manner and to be able to induce increased transcription of genes
which contained this binding site.
The effect of a transcription factor on a gene containing its DNA-binding
site can be demonstrated by preparing a reporter gene construct in which
the relevant DNA-binding site is cloned upstream of a control promoter
linked to a reporter gene encoding a readily assayable protein. As described
in Chapter 4 (Section 4.3), such a reporter gene construct can be used to
assess the effect of the test sequence on the activity of the control promoter
when the construct is introduced into a specific cell type (see Figure 4.38b).
To test the effect of a transcription factor binding to its binding site, the
method is modified so that the reporter construct is introduced into cells
with or without a DNA expression vector containing the gene encoding
the appropriate transcription factor. By assaying reporter gene activity in
the presence or absence of the transcription factor encoded by the expression vector, it is possible to test the effect on gene expression of the factor
binding to its DNA-binding site (Figure 5.5a).
For example, in the case of the homeotic gene fushi tarazu ( f tz), mutation of which produces a fly with only half the normal number of body segments, the protein has been shown to bind specifically to the sequence
TCAATTAAATGA. When the gene encoding the Ftz protein is introduced
into Drosophila cells with a reporter gene containing its binding sequence
linked to a control promoter, transcription of the reporter gene is increased.
This up-regulation is entirely dependent on binding of the Ftz protein to this
sequence in the promoter of the marker gene, since a one base pair change
in this sequence which abolishes binding also abolishes the induction of
transcription (Figure 5.5b).
The product of another homeotic gene, the engrailed protein (Eng),
binds to the identical sequence to that bound by Ftz. However, its binding
does not produce increased transcription of the reporter gene and indeed it
prevents the activation by Ftz. Hence, the expression of Ftz alone in a cell
would activate particular genes, whereas Ftz expression in a cell also
expressing the engrailed product would have no effect (Figure 5.6). In this
way interacting homeotic gene products expressed in particular cells could
control the developmental fate of the cells by regulating the expression of
specific target genes.

In other situations, it is possible for the prior DNA binding of one
transcription factor to enhance rather than inhibit the binding of another
transcription factor. The Ubx protein that is encoded by the homeotic gene
ultrabithorax (ubx) can interact with the extradenticle (Exd) protein. This
allows Ubx to bind to a specific DNA sequence when the Exd protein is
bound to an adjacent DNA-binding site, although it cannot bind to these
sites in the absence of Exd (Figure 5.7). As discussed in Chapter 9 (Section
9.2), this allows Ubx to activate the Decapentaplegic gene promoter, which
contains adjacent binding sites for Ubx and Exd.

Chapter 5: Transcription Factors and Transcriptional Control

Interestingly, there is evidence that the homeotic genes may be necessary not only for the actual production of a specific cell type but also for the
long-term process of commitment to a particular cellular phenotype, which
was discussed in Chapter 2 (Section 2.1). Thus, in the case of the imaginal
discs of Drosophila, commitment to the production of a particular adult
structure is maintained through many cell generations in the absence of
differentiation. If during this time, however, a mutation is introduced into
one of the homeotic genes in the disc cells inactivating it, when the cells are
allowed to differentiate they will produce the wrong structure. For example,
if the ubx gene is inactivated in a disc cell that normally gives rise to the
haltere (balancer) of the fly, these cells will produce wing tissue when
allowed to differentiate. The continual expression of homeotic genes within
the cells is essential for their commitment to a particular pathway of
differentiation.
A possible molecular mechanism for this is provided by the demonstration that the Ubx protein binds to its own promoter and up-regulates its own
transcription. Hence once production of this protein has been induced, presumably during the commitment process, it will continue indefinitely and
thus maintain this commitment (Figure 5.8).
In addition to this mechanism, other processes maintain the chromatin
structure of the homeotic genes in an active state so that transcription continues once the gene has initially been activated. This is achieved by members of the trithorax group of proteins, which include the GAGA and brahma
factors discussed in Chapter 3 (Section 3.5). These factors bind to active
homeotic genes and maintain them in an open chromatin structure, allowing transcription to continue.
Conversely, other proteins of the polycomb group bind to homeotic
genes and produce an inactive chromatin structure, so preventing their
inappropriate activation (see Chapter 3, Section 3.3 and Chapter 4, Section
4.4). As might be expected, mutations of the genes encoding trithorax or
polycomb group proteins result in gross abnormalities in the fly due to,
respectively, a failure to activate the appropriate homeotic genes or their
inappropriate activation (Figure 5.9) (see Chapter 9, Sections 9.1 and 9.2
for further discussion of the role of polycomb and trithorax proteins in
development).
Interestingly, as noted in Chapter 2 (Section 2.1), the changes in commitment that occur in imaginal discs when the cells are cultured for a long time
and the process of commitment breaks down, are precisely those that occur
in homeotic mutations. Hence, a change in the chromatin structure and
expression of a specific homeotic gene in the imaginal disc will result in a
change in the pattern of cellular commitment similar to that which occurs
when the homeotic gene is mutated.

sequence-specific DNA binding. When the genes encoding these proteins
were first cloned, it was found that they each contained a short related
DNA sequence of about 180 bp capable of encoding 60 amino acids
(Figure 5.10), which was flanked on either side by sequences that differed dramatically between the different genes. This sequence was named
the homeodomain (also known as the homeobox) and was shown to
bind to DNA in the identical sequence-specific manner to that exhibited by
the intact protein.
The localization of this DNA binding to a short region of the protein only
60 amino acids in length allowed a detailed structural prediction of the corresponding protein domain. This revealed that the homeodomain contains
a so-called helix-turn-helix motif which is highly conserved between the
different homeodomain-containing proteins. In this motif, a short region
which can form an α-helical structure is followed by a β-turn and then
another α-helical region. The position of these elements in the homeodomain is shown in Figure 5.10 and a diagram of the helix-turn-helix motif is
given in Figure 5.11.
The prediction that this structure exists in the DNA-binding homeodomain has been directly confirmed by X-ray crystallographic analysis.
Moreover, by carrying out this analysis on the homeodomain bound to its
DNA-binding site, it has been shown that the helix-turn-helix motif does
indeed contact DNA, with the second helix lying partly within the major
groove where it can make specific contacts with the base pairs of the DNA
(Figure 5.12). This second helix (labeled the recognition helix in the
homeodomain sequence in Figure 5.10) can thus mediate sequencespecific binding, while the other helix helps to correctly position the recognition helix.
The presence of this structure therefore indicates how the homeodomain proteins can bind specifically to particular DNA sequences, which is
the first step in transcriptional activation of their target genes. The role of
the helix-turn-helix motif in the recognition of specific sequences in the
DNA has been demonstrated directly. For example, in the Bicoid homeotic
transcription factor, a mutation which changes a lysine at position 9 of the
recognition helix to the glutamine found in the equivalent position of
the Antennapedia protein, results in the protein binding to DNA with the
sequence specificity of an Antennapedia rather than a Bicoid protein. In
contrast, exchange of the other amino acids in the recognition helix that
differ in the two proteins does not have this effect. Thus, certain amino
acids in the recognition helix play a critical role in determining the DNA
sequence that is bound by the protein.
It appears that the lysine at position 9 in Bicoid forms hydrogen bonds
with the O6 and N7 positions of a guanine base in the Bicoid-binding site. In
contrast, the glutamine at position 9 in Antennapedia forms hydrogen bonds
with the adenine base at the equivalent position in the DNA-binding site.
This explains how exchange of these amino acids changes binding site
specificity (Figure 5.13). Hence, not only does the helix-turn-helix motif
mediate DNA binding, but differences in the precise amino acid sequence of
this motif in different homeodomains control the precise DNA sequence to

which these proteins bind. The role of these proteins in Drosophila development is discussed further in Chapter 9 (Section 9.2).
The obvious importance of the homeodomain in Drosophila prompted a
search for proteins containing this element in other organisms. Indeed,
homeodomain-containing proteins that are expressed in specific cell types
in the early embryo and play a key regulatory role have now been identified
in a wide range of organisms including mammals (see Chapter 9, Section
9.3) and yeast (see Chapter 10, Section 10.3). Hence these proteins play a
vital role in the processes regulating cellular differentiation and development in a variety of different organisms.

FIgURe 5.13
changing the lysine (K) at position 9 in the
Bicoid recognition helix to the glutamine (Q)
found in Antennapedia allows recognition
of an A residue in the Antennapedia DNAbinding site rather than the G residue found
at the corresponding position in the Bicoid
DNA-binding site. This results in the hybrid
protein binding to the Antennapedia DNAbinding site even though all the other amino
acids in the recognition helix are derived
from the Bicoid protein.

In the pOU domain transcription factors, the homeodomain
forms part of a larger DNa-binding motif
As well as the homeodomain proteins, another class of regulatory proteins
has been identified which contains the homeodomain as one part of a much
larger (150–160 amino acids), conserved region known as the POU (pronounced POW) domain. Unlike the homeodomain proteins, these regulatory proteins were not identified by mutational analysis or by homology to
other regulatory proteins, but were characterized as transcription factors
having a particular pattern of activity.
Thus the mammalian Oct-1 and Oct-2 proteins both bind to the octamer
sequence (consensus ATGCAAATNA) in the promoters of genes such as the
histone H2B gene and those encoding the immunoglobulins and mediate
the transcriptional activation of these genes. When the genes encoding
these proteins were cloned they were found to possess a 150–160 amino
acid sequence that was also found in the mammalian Pit-1 protein, which
regulates gene expression in the pituitary by binding to a sequence related
to but distinct from the octamer. This sequence was also found in the protein encoded by the nematode gene unc-86 which is involved in sensory
neuron development.
This POU (Pit-Oct-Unc) domain contains both a homeodomain-like
sequence and a second conserved domain, the POU-specific domain
(Figure 5.14). Although there are some differences between different POU
proteins, in general the isolated homeodomain of the POU proteins alone
is sufficient for sequence-specific DNA binding, but unlike the classical
homeodomain, the binding is of relatively low affinity in the absence of the
POU-specific domain. Hence both parts of the POU domain are required for
high affinity sequence-specific DNA binding, indicating that the POU

DNA BINDING BY TRANSCRIPTION FACTORS
FIgURe 5.15
The oct-1 factor binds to distinct binding sites in cellular (a) or herpes
simplex virus (b) genes in different structural configurations, only one of
which allows binding of the viral activator protein VP16 which strongly
activates transcription.

homeodomain and the POU-specific domain form two parts of a DNAbinding element which are held together by a flexible linker sequence.
Like the POU homeodomain, the POU-specific domain can also form a
helix-turn-helix motif. The recognition helix from the POU-specific domain
and that from the POU homeodomain bind to adjacent regions within the
major groove of the DNA. This further illustrates the importance of the
helix-turn-helix motif in allowing DNA binding by specific transcription
factors.
Interestingly, the POU factors illustrate a novel aspect of gene regulation,
namely that the sequence of the DNA-binding site to which a factor binds
can influence its conformation and thus its effect on gene expression. For
example, when the Oct-1 POU factor binds to its target sequence
(ATGCAAAT) in cellular genes, it activates transcription only weakly. However, when it binds to a different target sequence (TAATGARAT; R = purine)
in the herpes simplex virus (HSV) immediate-early genes, it binds in a distinct configuration. This allows it to interact with the HSV protein VP16,
which is a strong activator of transcription and hence strong transcriptional
activation occurs (Figure 5.15).
This type of effect is not confined to the recruitment of a viral protein
by a cellular factor. When the Pit-1 protein binds to the prolactin gene
promoter it activates transcription. However, the growth hormone gene
promoter has a distinct sequence which binds Pit-1 but produces a different
tertiary structure of the Pit-1 protein. This allows Pit-1 to bind the cellular
co-repressor NCo-R and hence transcription is repressed (Figure 5.16).
Thus, the sequence of the DNA-binding site can affect the configuration of
the bound factor and therefore its ability to recruit other regulatory molecules and to activate or repress transcription.
It is clear, therefore, that the POU proteins represent a family of proteins
related to the homeodomain proteins which are likely to play a critical role
in development and cellular differentiation. For example, inactivation of the
Pit-1 gene leads to a failure of pituitary gland development resulting in
dwarfism in mice and humans, while the unc-86 mutation results in a failure
to form specific neurons in the nematode.
Interestingly, the two highly conserved peptide sequences at either end
of the POU domain (Figure 5.14) have been used to isolate novel members
of the POU family. Highly degenerate oligonucleotides were prepared which
contained all the possible DNA sequences able to encode these conserved
amino acid sequences (Figure 5.17). These oligonucleotides were then
used as primers in a polymerase chain reaction (PCR) to amplify cDNA prepared from the mRNA of different tissues (see Chapter 1, Section 1.2, for
another use of the PCR technique, namely to quantitate mRNA levels). The
degenerate oligonucleotides amplified cDNAs derived from the mRNAs
encoding novel POU proteins, which like the original POU proteins

contained the conserved sequences characteristic of such factors. Many of
these novel factors isolated in this way have now also been shown to play
critical roles in development.
Such sequence homology methods of isolating novel transcription
factors are being used increasingly to clone novel factors, considerably
supplementing the direct cloning methods described earlier in this chapter. Hence, once several members of a transcription factor family have
been identified by conventional means, further members of the family can
be identified and characterized in this way. Indeed, as more and more
complete genomes are analyzed by DNA sequencing, they can be scanned
electronically to identify novel DNA sequences related to those of known
transcription factors, providing an in silico approach to the identification of
novel transcription factors.

The two-cysteine–two-histidine zinc finger is found in multiple
copies in many transcription factors
As discussed in Chapter 4 (Section 4.1), the transcription factor TFIIIA binds
to the internal control region of the 5S ribosomal RNA gene and plays a
critical role in its transcription by RNA polymerase III. This transcription
factor was among the first to be purified. The pure protein was shown to
have a periodic repeated structure and to contain between 7 and 11 atoms
of zinc associated with each molecule of the pure protein.
The basis for this repeated structure was revealed when the gene encoding this protein was cloned and used to predict the corresponding amino
acid sequence. This protein sequence contained 9 repeats of a 30 amino
acid sequence of the form Tyr/Phe-X-Cys-X-Cys-X2–4-Cys-X3-Phe-X5-LeuX2-His-X3–4-His-X5, where X is any amino acid. This repeating structure
contains two invariant pairs of cysteine and histidine residues which were
predicted to bind a single zinc atom, accounting for the multiple zinc atoms
bound by the purified protein.
This 30 amino acid repeating unit is referred to as a zinc finger, on
the basis that a loop of 12 amino acids (containing the conserved leucine
and phenylalanine residues as well as several basic residues) projects
from the surface of the protein. The finger is anchored at its base by the
conserved cysteine and histidine residues which directly coordinate an
atom of zinc (Figure 5.18). The binding of zinc by the cysteine and histidine residues has been confirmed directly by X-ray crystallographic analysis of the TFIIIA protein. Such structural studies have also revealed that
the finger region consists of two antiparallel β-sheets and an α-helix
packed against one of the β-sheets, with the α-helix contacting the major
groove of the DNA as occurs for the recognition helix of the homeodomain proteins (Figure 5.19).
It is clear therefore, that like the helix-turn-helix motif, the zinc finger
represents a protein structure capable of mediating the DNA binding ability
of transcription factors. Moreover, as described in Section 5.5, it also allows
TFIIIA to bind to the 5S ribosomal RNA itself as well as to the gene encoding
this RNA. Although originally identified in the RNA polymerase III transcription factor TFIIIA, the zinc finger motif has now been identified in a number
of RNA polymerase II transcription factors as well and has been shown to
play a critical role in their ability to bind to DNA and thereby influence transcription (Table 5.1).
For example, three contiguous copies of the 30 amino acid zinc finger
motif are found in the transcription factor Spl whose cloning was discussed
earlier. The sequence-specific binding pattern of the intact Spl protein can
be reproduced by expressing in Escherichia coli a truncated protein containing only the zinc finger region, confirming the importance of this region in
DNA binding. Similarly, the Drosophila Kruppel protein which is vital for
proper thoracic and abdominal development (see Chapter 9, Section 9.2),
contains four zinc finger motifs. A single mutation that results in the replacement of the conserved cysteine in one of these fingers by a serine which
cannot bind zinc, leads to the complete abolition of the function of the

protein. This results in a mutant fly whose appearance is indistinguishable
from that produced by complete deletion of the Kruppel gene.
Within the zinc finger DNA-binding domain, the amino acids at the
N-terminus of the α-helix immediately preceding the first histidine residue
play a key role in DNA binding. Thus, the Drosophila Krox 20 factor binds
the DNA sequence 5′GCGGGGGCG3′. This protein has three zinc fingers,
with the central finger contacting the GGG bases at the center of the binding
site and the outer fingers each contacting one of the flanking GCG triplets.
The central finger has a glutamine residue at position 18 and an arginine at position 21, whereas the outer fingers have histidine and threonine
at these positions. Changing the glutamine and arginine in the central
finger to their equivalents in the outer fingers produces a protein that cannot bind to its normal DNA-binding sequence. Instead, it binds to the
sequence 5′GCGGCGGCG3′, indicating that changing the amino acids in
the central finger has changed its binding specificity to that of the outer
fingers (Figure 5.20).

Chapter 5: Transcription Factors and Transcriptional Control

Further studies along these lines have made it possible to predict the
DNA-binding specificity of zinc fingers with particular amino acids at specific positions and to design new fingers with novel DNA-binding specificities. As well as aiding our understanding of how zinc finger factors bind to
DNA, these studies also lead to potential therapeutic mechanisms to control
gene expression in human diseases using designer fingers with specific DNA
binding specificities. Such applications are discussed further in Chapter 12
(Section 12.6).
The zinc finger represents a DNA-binding element which is present in
variable numbers in many regulatory proteins. Indeed, the linkage between
the presence of this motif and the ability to regulate gene expression is so
strong that, as with the homeodomain, it has been used as a probe to isolate
the genes encoding new regulatory proteins. The DNA sequence encoding
the Kruppel zinc finger for example, has been used in this way to isolate Xfin,
a 37 finger protein expressed in the early Xenopus embryo (Figure 5.21).
Hence, zinc finger proteins are likely to be involved in controlling development in vertebrates as well as in Drosophila where numerous proteins
involved in regulating development such as Kruppel, Hunchback, and Snail
contain zinc fingers. The interactions of these proteins with the homeodomain proteins, which contain the alternative DNA-binding helix-turn-helix
motif, are of central importance in the development of Drosophila and other
organisms (see Chapter 9, Section 9.2).

The nuclear receptors contain two copies of a multi-cysteine zinc
finger distinct from the two-cysteine–two-histidine zinc finger
Throughout this work we have noted that the effect of steroid hormones on
mammalian gene expression is one of the best characterized examples of
gene regulation. The steroid-regulated genes were among the first to be
shown to be regulated at the level of gene transcription (Chapter 1, Section
1.4) by means of the binding of specific hormone receptors to specific DNA
sequences (Chapter 4, Section 4.3), resulting in a change in chromatin
structure and the generation of a DNAaseI hypersensitive site (Chapter 3,
Section 3.5). When the genes encoding the DNA-binding receptors for the
various steroid hormones such as glucocorticoid and estrogen were cloned,
they were found to constitute a family of proteins encoded by distinct but
related genes. In turn, these proteins were related to other receptors that
mediated the response of the cell to hormones such as thyroid hormone,
retinoic acid or vitamin D. This led to the idea of an evolutionarily related

family of genes encoding nuclear receptors known as the steroid-thyroid
hormone receptor gene superfamily or the nuclear receptor gene superfamily (Figure 5.22).
When the detailed structures of the members of this family were compared (Figure 5.22), it was found that each had a multidomain structure,
which included a central highly conserved domain. On the basis of experiments in which truncated versions of the receptors were introduced into
cells and their activities measured, it was shown that this conserved domain
mediated the DNA-binding ability of the receptor while the C-terminal
region was involved in the binding of the appropriate hormone and the
N-terminal region was involved in producing maximal induction of transcription of target genes.
Sequence analysis of the DNA-binding domain in a variety of receptors
showed that it conformed to a consensus sequence of the form Cys-X2-CysX13-Cys-X2-Cys-X15–17-Cys-X5-Cys-X9-Cys-X2-Cys-X4-Cys. Like the cysteinehistidine fingers described above, the DNA-binding ability of this domain is
dependent upon the presence of zinc or a related heavy metal such as
cadmium. Moreover, this element can be drawn as two conventional
zinc fingers in which four cysteines replace the two-cysteine–two-histidine structure of the conventional finger in binding zinc and which are
separated by a linker region containing the 15–17 variable amino acids
(Figure 5.23). Such a predicted structure is supported by spectrographic
analysis of this region of the receptor, which clearly demonstrates the
presence of two zinc atoms each coordinated by four cysteines in a tetrahedral array (Figure 5.24).
However, such structural analysis also indicates that the two fingers in
the steroid receptors interact with one another to form a single structural
element (Figure 5.24). This contrasts with the situation in the cysteine–
histidine fingers where each finger forms a separate structural unit.
Moreover, the multi-cysteine finger cannot be converted to a cysteine–
histidine finger by substituting two of its cysteines with histidines. Thus
while the multi-cysteine domain is clearly similar to the cysteine–histidine
domain in its coordination of zinc, it is distinct in its lack of histidines and
conserved phenylalanine and leucine residues as well as in its structure.
Therefore the two elements are unlikely to be evolutionarily related.

Whatever the precise relationship of the multi-cysteine domain to the
cysteine–histidine finger, it is clear that like this type of finger, the multicysteine domain in the nuclear receptors is involved in mediating DNA
binding (Figure 5.25). Similar single domains containing multiple cysteines
separated by nonconserved residues have also been identified in other DNAbinding proteins, such as the yeast transcription factors GAL4, PPRI, LAC9,
etc., all of which contain a cluster of six invariant cysteines, and in the adenovirus transactivator, E1A, which has a cluster of four cysteines within the
region that mediates trans-activation (Table 5.2).
The existence of a short DNA-binding region in a number of different
nuclear receptors which bind distinct but related DNA sequences (Chapter
4, Section 4.3) has allowed a dissection of the elements that are important
for sequence-specific DNA binding. As illustrated in Table 4.4, the DNA
sequences that confer responsiveness to glucocorticoid or estrogen treatment are distinct but related to one another. If the cysteine-rich region of
the estrogen receptor is replaced by that of the glucocorticoid receptor, a
chimeric receptor is obtained which has the DNA-binding specificity of the
glucocorticoid receptor but, because all the other regions of the protein are
derived from the estrogen receptor, it continues to bind estrogen. Hence this
hybrid receptor induces the expression of glucocorticoid-responsive genes
(which carry its DNA-binding site) in response to treatment with estrogen
(to which it binds) (Figure 5.26).

Further so-called finger-swap experiments using smaller parts of this
region have shown that this change in specificity can also be achieved by
the exchange of the N-terminal four-cysteine finger together with the region
immediately following it, which are therefore critical for determining
sequence-specific binding to DNA.
These findings have been further refined by exchanging individual amino
acids in this region of the glucocorticoid receptor for their equivalents in the
estrogen receptor. As shown in Figure 5.27, the alteration of the two
amino acids (GS) between the third and fourth cysteines of the N-terminal
finger to their estrogen receptor equivalents (EG) results in a glucocorticoid
receptor that switches on estrogen-responsive genes. Hence the change of
only two critical amino acids within a protein of 777 amino acids can completely change the DNA-binding specificity of the receptor.
The specificity of the hybrid receptor for estrogen-responsive genes can
be further enhanced by changing another amino acid that is located in the
linker region between the two fingers (V to A, Figure 5.27), indicating that
this region also plays a role in controlling the specificity of binding to DNA.
In contrast to the effect of mutations in the first finger and adjacent
region, further alteration of five amino acids in the second finger is sufficient
to change the binding specificity of the receptor, such that it now recognizes
the thyroid hormone receptor-binding sites (Figure 5.27). Thyroid hormonebinding sites do not differ from those of the estrogen receptor in sequence
but only in the spacing between the two halves of the palindromic DNA
recognition sequence (see Table 4.4a). These findings indicate that the second finger is critical for mediating protein–protein interactions between the
two copies of the receptor that bind to the two halves of their palindromic

target sequence (see Chapter 4, Section 4.3). Thus the second finger controls the optimal spacing of these dimers for binding to their particular
response elements in the DNA.
Structural studies of the two zinc fingers have shown that the key amino
acids for DNA binding at the N-terminal of the first finger are located in an
α-helical region. This further supports the key role of such α-helices in
sequence-specific DNA binding. Conversely, the key amino acids in the second finger which determine the optimal spacing of the two halves of the
DNA recognition sequence are located on the surface of the receptor.
Hence, they can control the interaction of two receptor molecules to form a
homodimer able to bind to the two halves of the recognition sequence.
As well as determining the nature of the receptor homodimers which
bind to the palindromic repeats illustrated in Table 4.4a, the DNA-binding
dimerization domain also plays a critical role in determining the receptors which bind to the hormone response elements that contain direct
repeat sequences (illustrated in Table 4.4b). When these direct repeats are
separated by only one base, they can bind a homodimer of the retinoidX-receptor (RXR) and hence confer responsiveness to 9-cis-retinoic acid
which binds to this receptor (Figure 5.28). In contrast, the RXR homodimer cannot bind to the response elements when the direct repeats are
separated by two, three, four or five base pairs. On these response elements the DNA-binding domain of RXR interacts with the DNA-binding
domain of another member of the nuclear receptor family to form heterodimers that can bind to each of these sites.
In these heterodimer combinations, the effect of RXR is suppressed and
the response of the heterodimer is determined by the other component. For
example, binding sites with a spacing of two or five base pairs bind a heterodimer of RXR and the retinoic acid receptor (RAR) and confer responsiveness to all-trans-retinoic acid which binds to RAR. A spacing of four
base pairs binds a heterodimer of RXR and the thyroid hormone receptor
and therefore responds to thyroid hormone, while a spacing of three base
pairs binds a heterodimer of RXR and the vitamin D receptor, leading to
responsiveness to vitamin D (Figure 5.28). The structure of the RXR/vitamin
D receptor bound to its DNA-binding site has recently been determined by
cryo-electron microscopy (Figure 5.29).
Thus, it is the different DNA-binding dimerization domains of the various nuclear receptors that produce different patterns of homodimer and
heterodimer binding to different binding sites in the promoters or enhancers
of different genes. In turn, this allows the diverse members of the nuclear
receptor family to produce different responses to the various hormones that
bind to the different receptors.

The leucine zipper is a dimerization domain which allows DNa
binding by the adjacent basic domain
In earlier sections of this chapter, we have examined how the presence of
specific structural motifs such as the zinc finger and the homeodomain in
several different regulatory proteins led to the identification of the crucial
role of these elements in DNA binding. A similar approach has led to the
identification of another such motif, the leucine zipper. In studies of the
gene encoding the transcription factor C/EBPα, which is involved in stimulating the expression of several liver-specific genes, it was noted that it contained a region of 35 amino acids in which every seventh amino acid was a
leucine. Similar runs of leucine residues were also noted in the yeast transcriptional regulatory protein GCN4 as well as in the proto-oncogene proteins Myc, Fos, and Jun, which were originally identified on the basis of
their ability to transform cultured cells to a cancerous phenotype (see
Chapter 11, Sections 11.1 and 11.2) and act as transcription factors regulating the transcription of cellular genes involved in cellular proliferation
(Figure 5.30).

Chapter 5: Transcription Factors and Transcriptional Control

It was proposed that the leucine-rich region would form an α-helix in
which the leucines would occur every two turns on the same side of the
helix. The hydrophobic side chains of the leucine residues in one molecule
would then interact with the corresponding side chains in another molecule. This would promote interdigitation of the helices in the two molecules,
so allowing the formation of a dimer (Figure 5.31). In agreement with this
idea, replacement of individual leucine residues in C/EBPα with valine or
isoleucine residues abolished the ability of the protein to form a dimer. In
turn, these mutations also prevented the binding of the protein to its specific
recognition sequence.
Unlike the helix-turn-helix motif, however, the leucine zipper does not
bind directly to DNA. Rather, by facilitating the dimerization of the transcription factors it provides the correct protein structure for DNA binding by
the adjacent region of the protein which is rich in basic amino acids that can
interact directly with the acidic DNA (Figure 5.32). In agreement with this
idea, mutations in the basic DNA-binding domain abolish the ability of
the protein to bind to the DNA without abolishing its ability to dimerize.
Similar juxtapositions of a basic DNA-binding domain and the leucine zipper are also found in the Fos and Jun oncogene proteins and in the yeast
transcription factor GCN4, where a single 60 amino acid region contains all
the information needed for both dimerization and sequence-specific DNA
binding. Hence the leucine zipper has a role similar to that of the second
zinc finger in the nuclear receptors (see above), which modulates the activity of the DNA-binding region rather than being involved directly in
binding.
Following dimerization mediated via the leucine zipper, the transcription factor will form a symmetric dimer with the bifurcating basic regions
contacting the DNA (Figure 5.32). These basic regions form α-helical structures which track in opposite directions along the dyad symmetric structure
of the DNA recognition site. They form a clamp or scissors grip around the
DNA similar to the grip of a wrestler on his opponent, resulting in very tight
DNA–protein binding.

Although originally identified in leucine zipper-containing proteins, the
basic DNA-binding domain has also been identified by homology comparisons in a number of other transcriptional regulatory proteins that lack the
leucine zipper. In these cases however, the basic domain is associated with
an adjacent region that can form a helix-loop-helix structure. This motif is
distinct from the helix-turn-helix motif in the homeodomain factors (see

amino acids on one side of the helix) separated by an intervening nonhelical loop. Although originally thought to be the DNA-binding domain of

these proteins, this helix-loop-helix motif is now known to play a similar
role to the leucine zipper, mediating protein dimerization and facilitating
DNA binding by the adjacent basic DNA-binding motif.
The helix-loop-helix motif with its adjacent basic DNA-binding region is
present in a number of different transcription factors expressed in different
tissues. For example, it is present in a number of factors that are critical for
the correct development of the nervous system (see Chapter 10, Section
10.2). Similarly, this motif is found in several of the factors that control muscle development, such as the MyoD transcription factor whose artificial
expression in an undifferentiated fibroblast cell line can induce it to differentiate into skeletal muscle cells by activating the expression of musclespecific genes. Thus, the MyoD gene is likely to be the critical regulatory
locus which is activated by treatment of these cells with 5-azacytidine,
allowing this agent to induce these cells to differentiate into muscle cells
(see Chapter 3, Section 3.2 and Chapter 10, Section 10.1).

Dimerization between factors provides an additional level
of regulation
The leucine zipper and helix-loop-helix structures therefore act to mediate
the dimerization of transcription factors, so forming dimeric molecules that
are able to bind to DNA via an adjacent basic DNA-binding domain. This
ability provides an additional aspect to gene regulation by such proteins.
Thus, in addition to the formation of a dimer by two identical factors, it is
possible to envisage the formation of a heterodimer between two different
factors that might have different properties in terms of sequence-specific
binding and gene activation compared with homodimers of one or other of
the two factors.
Such homo- and heterodimerization resulting in binding to different
response elements occurs in the case of the nuclear receptors, as discussed
above. In the case of basic domain-containing factors, an example of this
type is seen in the case of the oncoproteins Fos and Jun (see Chapter 11,
Section 11.2). Jun can bind as a homodimer to the AP1 recognition
sequence, TGAGTCAG, which mediates transcriptional induction by phorbol
esters (see Table 4.3). In contrast, Fos cannot bind to DNA alone but can
form a heterodimer with the Jun protein. This heterodimer binds to the AP1
recognition site with a 30-fold greater affinity than the Jun homodimer and
is considerably more effective in enhancing transcription of genes containing the binding site. Both hetero- and homodimer formation and DNA
binding are dependent on the leucine zipper motif, which is found in both
proteins. Hence dimerization by the leucine zipper motif allows two different complexes with different binding affinities and different activity to form
on the identical DNA-binding site (Figure 5.33).
Recently, detailed studies have shown that a highly complex network
of interactions occurs between different leucine zipper-containing proteins. For example, the human genome encodes 53 different basic domain/
leucine zipper-containing proteins and many of these can interact with
one another to form heterodimers. Moreover, as well as altering the affinity for a particular DNA-binding site (as in the Fos–Jun case), such

heterodimerization can also result in a change in DNA-binding specificity,
allowing the heterodimer to bind a different sequence than that bound by
either homodimer.
As well as having a positive regulatory role, heterodimerization can
also have a negative role. For example, the ability of the MyoD factor to
stimulate gene expression is inhibited by heterodimerization with the Id
factor, which has a helix-turn-helix motif but no basic domain. Since DNA
binding requires the cooperation of two basic domains within the heterodimer, the MyoD–Id heterodimer cannot bind to DNA. Hence MyoD cannot
activate the expression of muscle-specific genes and therefore cannot promote the production of skeletal muscle cells in the presence of the Id factor
(Figure 5.34) (for further discussion of gene regulation in skeletal muscle
by MyoD and other factors see Chapter 10, Section 10.1).
It is clear therefore, that the ability to form different dimeric complexes
between different transcription factors – whether mediated by leucine zipper, helix-loop-helix or nuclear receptor dimerization domains – is likely
to play a crucial role in the regulation of gene expression by producing
complexes with different DNA-binding affinities and different activities.

Other domains can also mediate DNa binding
As the genes encoding more and more transcription factors are isolated and
characterized, it has become clear that while the DNA-binding domains of
many factors fall into the four classes discussed above, not all do so.
Additional types of DNA-binding motifs exist. Interestingly, however, as the
structures of these DNA-binding domains are progressively understood,
relationships between the different classes of DNA-binding domain have
emerged. Structural analysis of the Ets DNA-binding domain, which is present for example in the ets-1 proto-oncogene (see Chapter 11, Section 11.2)
and the mouse PU-1 gene demonstrated that it is identical to the wingedhelix-turn-helix or forkhead DNA-binding motif identified in the Drosophila
forkhead factor and the mammalian transcription factor FoxA1 (also
known as HNF-3: see Chapter 3, Section 3.5). Hence all these factors share
a common winged-helix-turn-helix motif.
As its name suggests, this motif contains a helix-turn-helix structure
that is also present in the homeodomain proteins discussed above. These
two DNA-binding motifs are thus related to one another. However, the
winged-helix-turn-helix motif also contains a β-sheet structure with two
loops which appear as wings protruding from the factor, thereby giving it
its name. In the majority of winged-helix-containing proteins, it is the
helix-turn-helix motif that is responsible for DNA binding. However, in the
winged helix-containing protein hRFX1, it is the β-sheet wing structure
which binds to the DNA rather than the helix-turn-helix motif, indicating
that members of the winged helix family can use one of two distinct structures to bind to DNA.
In another example of the relationship of different groups of factors, the
existence of the POU DNA-binding domain containing a POU-specific

FIgURe 5.34
DNA binding by the MyoD protein is inhibited
by the Id factor, which contains the helixloop-helix dimerization motif but not the
basic DNA-binding domain.

domain in addition to a POU homeodomain (see above), is paralleled in the
Pax family of vertebrate transcription factors, many of which contain both a
homeodomain and a so-called “paired” domain, both of which contribute to
high-affinity DNA binding. Unlike the POU-specific domain, however, the
paired domain can be found as an isolated DNA-binding domain without
the homeodomain, in some members of the PAX family and in several
Drosophila factors, including the paired gene in which it was originally identified (Figure 5.35).
Interestingly, the Drosophila Pax factor eyeless and the mammalian factors Pax3 and Pax6 (see Chapter 12, Section 12.1), play key roles in the
development of the eye in these organisms, despite the very different structures of the eye in insects and mammals.
It is clear therefore that a number of different structures exist which can
mediate sequence-specific DNA binding and many of these are related to
one another. The features of the most common DNA-binding motifs and
their associated dimerization domains are summarized in Table 5.3. Each
of these DNA-binding motifs is common to a number of different transcription factors, with differences in the precise amino acid sequence of the
motif in each factor controlling the precise DNA sequence to which it binds
and hence the target genes for the factor.

Chapter 5: Transcription Factors and Transcriptional Control

Interestingly, the four major DNA-binding motifs we have discussed (the
helix-turn-helix, the basic domain, and the two types of zinc finger),
although unrelated to one another, all utilize an α-helical region for DNA
binding, with certain amino acids in this region having a key role in determining binding specificity. This leads to the question as to why the different
families actually exist rather than there being one universal DNA-binding
domain.
This may simply reflect the fact that these domains evolved independently in different factors and have been retained since they efficiently
fulfilled their function. Alternatively, the different motifs may be important
because of differences in the DNA-binding requirements of the factors
that contain them. Thus, a DNA-binding domain with multiple twocysteine–two-histidine zinc fingers may be optimal for factors such as
TFIIIA which need to contact an extended regulatory region. In contrast,
a basic domain, which can only bind to DNA as a dimer, would be appropriate where a factor is regulated by homodimerization with itself or
heterodimerization with another family member.

The DNa sequence bound by a particular transcription factor and
the effect of such binding is affected by the presence or absence
of other regulatory factors
In initial studies using techniques such as the DNA mobility shift assay (see
Chapter 4, Section 4.3), it was possible to define the DNA sequences to
which a particular factor could bind in vitro and hence characterize its DNAbinding specificity. More recently however, studies using the ChIP technique
have defined the DNA sequences to which a particular factor actually binds
in intact cells and have shown that such sequences are different under different conditions (see Chapter 4, Section 4.3).
This is because, in many cases, the DNA-binding specificity of a particular transcription factor is modulated by the presence or absence of other
factors. For example, a factor may only bind to a particular DNA-binding
site if another factor is bound at an adjacent site and can interact with it
(Figure 5.36a). Hence, if the second factor is absent, no binding of the first
factor to certain sites will occur. An example of this was discussed above
in which the Ubx homeodomain protein can only bind to certain DNAbinding sites when it interacts with the Exd protein that has bound to its
adjacent DNA-binding site (see Figure 5.7).

with which it can interact. (b) A heterodimer
of two transcription factors (A and B) can

ACTIVATION OF TRANSCRIPTION
In a different but related mechanism, two transcription factors can
form a heterodimer which then binds to DNA with a different specificity to
that of either factor alone (Figure 5.36b). Hence, a particular transcription factor will only be able to bind to the heterodimer target site in cells
where its heterodimerization partner is expressed. Examples of this effect
have been discussed above both for the nuclear receptors and in leucine
zipper-containing proteins where heterodimers of different family members can bind to DNA sequences different from those bound by each
homodimer (see Figure 5.28).
Interestingly, such heterodimerization can take place between members
of different transcription factor families as well as within a single family. As
discussed in Chapter 10 (Section 10.3), the DNA-binding specificity of the
yeast α2 homeodomain protein is modified in different ways by interaction
with either the nonhomeodomain transcription factor MCMI or the a1 homeodomain transcription factor. It is clear, therefore, that the precise DNA
sequence bound by a particular factor will be affected by the presence or
absence of other factors with which it can interact either on or off the DNA.
Moreover, as discussed above for the POU proteins, it is also possible
for DNA binding by a transcription factor to produce different effects
depending on the precise DNA sequence to which it has bound. Thus, a
transcription factor may adopt different protein configurations when binding to different DNA sequences and this will then affect the other proteins
that it can recruit (see Figures 5.15 and 5.16). As discussed in the next two
sections, the recruitment of co-activators and co-repressors by DNA-bound
transcriptional activators or repressors, respectively, plays a critical role in
transcriptional activation or repression. Thus, differences in the factors
recruited by a factor bound to different DNA sequences will play a significant role in determining its effect on the transcription of its target genes.

5.2 A aCTIVaTION OF TRaNSCRIpTION
Although binding of transcription factors to DNA is generally a necessary
prerequisite for the activation of transcription, it is clearly not in itself sufficient for this to occur. Following binding, the bound transcription factor
must somehow regulate transcription, for example, by directly activating
the RNA polymerase itself or by facilitating the binding of other transcription factors and the assembly of a stable transcriptional complex or by
recruiting chromatin remodeling complexes.

A
It is clear from Section 5.1 of this chapter that transcription factors have a
modular structure in which a particular region of the protein mediates DNA
binding, while another may mediate binding of a co-factor such as a hormone, and so on. It seems likely, therefore, that a specific region of each
individual transcription factor will be involved in its ability to up-regulate
transcription following DNA binding.
In the majority of cases, it is clear that such activation regions are distinct from those that produce DNA binding. This domain-type structure is
seen clearly in the yeast transcription factor GCN4, which mediates the
induction of the genes encoding the enzymes of amino acid biosynthesis in
response to amino acid starvation. If a 60 amino acid region of this protein
containing the DNA-binding domain is introduced into cells, it can bind to
the DNA of GCN4-responsive genes but fails to activate transcription.
Although DNA binding is necessary for transcriptional activation to occur, it
is not therefore sufficient, and gene activation must be dependent upon a
region of the protein that is distinct from that mediating its binding to DNA.
Unlike the DNA-binding region, the region of a transcription factor that
mediates gene activation cannot be identified on the basis of a simple assay
of its ability to bind to DNA or to another protein. Rather, a functional assay
of gene activation following binding to DNA is required. Such activation

regions have therefore been identified on the basis of so-called “domainswap” experiments in which the DNA-binding region of one transcription
factor is combined with various regions of another factor and the ability to
activate transcription of a gene containing the binding site of the first factor
is assessed (Figure 5.37). Following binding of the hybrid factor to the
target gene-binding site, gene activation will occur only if the hybrid factor
also contains an activation domain provided by the second factor. Hence the
activation domains of transcription factors can be identified in this manner.
In the case of the yeast transcription factor GCN4 discussed above, if a
60 amino acid region outside the DNA-binding domain is linked to the DNAbinding region of the bacterial regulatory protein LexA, the hybrid factor
will activate transcription in yeast from a gene containing the binding site
for LexA, whereas neither the LexA DNA-binding domain nor the GCN4
region will do so alone. This region of GCN4 therefore contains an activation domain that can increase transcription following DNA binding and is
separate from the region of the protein that normally mediates DNA binding
(Figure 5.38a).
Following its initial use in yeast, similar domain-swapping experiments
have also been used to identify the activation domains of many mammalian
transcription factors. In the glucocorticoid receptor, for example, two independent regions each able to produce gene activation have been identified
in this way (Figure 5.38b).

ACTIVATION OF TRANSCRIPTION
The success of domain-swap experiments is further proof of the modular nature of transcription factors, allowing the DNA-binding domain of one
factor and the activation domain of another to cooperate together to produce gene activation. This is analogous to the exchange of the DNA-binding
domain of the glucocorticoid and estrogen receptors, which allows the creation of a hybrid receptor that binds to estrogen-responsive genes through
the DNA-binding domain but is responsive to the presence of glucocorticoid
through the steroid-binding domain of the protein (see Figure 5.26).
An extreme example of this modularity is provided by the herpes simplex virus trans-activating protein VP16, discussed in Section 5.1, which
transcriptionally activates the viral immediate-early genes during lytic infection of mammalian cells. Although this protein contains a very potent activation region that can strongly induce gene transcription when fused to the
DNA-binding domain of GAL4, it contains no DNA-binding domain and
cannot bind to DNA itself. Rather, following infection it forms a complex
with the cellular octamer-binding protein, Oct-1. Oct-1 provides the DNAbinding domain which allows binding to the sequence TAATGARAT
(R = purine) in the viral promoters and activation is achieved by the activation domain of VP16. Hence, in this instance, DNA binding and activation
motifs actually reside on separate molecules (Figure 5.39).

Several different classes of activation domain exist
Using the domain-swapping approaches described above, three major
classes of activation domain have been identified (Table 5.4). The most
common of these classes of activation domain typically contains a very high
proportion of acidic amino acids, resulting in a strong net negative charge,
and is referred to as the acidic activation domain.
For example, in the N-terminal activating region of the glucocorticoid
receptor, 17 acidic amino acids are contained in an 82 amino acid region.
Similarly, the activating region of the yeast factor GCN4 contains 17 negative charges in an activating region of only 60 amino acids. This has led to
the idea that activation regions consist of so-called “acid blobs” or “negative
noodles” which are necessary for the activation of transcription. However,
although the net negative charge in acidic activation regions is likely to be
of importance in their ability to stimulate transcription, it appears that other
features such as the presence of several conserved hydrophobic residues
are also necessary for transcriptional activation.
Indeed, studies of the acidic activation domain of the VP16 transcription
factor have suggested a two-stage process of transcriptional activation
involving both the negatively charged residues and the conserved hydrophobic residues. Thus, VP16 can stimulate transcription by interacting with the
TAFII31 component of TFIID (also known as TAFII40) (see below for the role
of the TAF components of TFIID as targets for transcriptional activators).
This occurs initially via a long-range electrostatic interaction between the
negatively charged acidic residues of the VP16 activation domain and
positively charged residues in TAFII31. This initial interaction produces a
conformational change in the VP16 activation domain, forming an α-helical
structure which brings together three hydrophobic residues in the activation
domain that then interact with TAFII31 (Figure 5.40). Such a two-step interaction mechanism mediated by acidic and hydrophobic amino acids has

Chapter 5: Transcription Factors and Transcriptional Control

subsequently been demonstrated for other cellular acidic activators, indicating that this mechanism is not unique to the viral VP16 transactivator.
Although acidic domains have been identified in a wide range of transcriptional activators from yeast to man (Table 5.4), it is clear that this type of
structure is not the only one which can mediate transcriptional activation. For
example, of the two regions of the human Spl transcription factor that can
mediate activation of transcription, neither is particularly rich in negatively
charged acidic amino acids. Instead, each of these two domains is particularly rich in glutamine residues, and the intactness of the glutamine-rich
region is essential for transcriptional activation. Similar sequences have also
been identified in the homeotic proteins Antennapedia and Cut, as well as in
Zeste, another Drosophila transcriptional regulator, and in the POU proteins
Oct-1 and Oct-2, indicating that this type of activating region is not confined
to a single class of transcription factors.
A further type of activation domain has been identified in the transcription factor CTF/NF1 which binds to the CCAAT box present in many eukaryotic promoters (see Chapter 4, Table 4.2). The activation domain of this
protein is not rich in acidic or glutamine residues but instead contains
numerous proline residues, forming approximately one-quarter of the
amino acids in this region. Similar proline-rich regions are found in other
transcription factors, such as AP2 and Jun. Hence, as with DNA-binding
domains, it is clear that several distinct protein motifs are involved in the
activation of transcription (Table 5.4).
To activate transcription, transcriptional activators interact either
directly or indirectly with a variety of different targets and these will be
discussed in turn. Clearly such interactions could stimulate transcription by
increasing the binding of a particular component of the basal transcriptional complex, thus enhancing its assembly (Figure 5.41a). Alternatively,
stimulation could occur by the activator altering the conformation of an
already bound factor, thus stimulating the activity and/or stability of the
complex (Figure 5.41b). It is clear that both of these mechanisms are
actually used and they can evidently operate whether the basal complex
actually assembles in a fully stepwise fashion where each component binds
sequentially or in a situation where several components bind together in a
holoenzyme complex with RNA polymerase itself (see Chapter 4, Section
4.1 for further discussion of these alternative models of complex assembly). In discussing the various targets within the complex however, we
shall consider them in the order in which they bind in the stepwise model.

A
As described in Chapter 4 (Section 4.1), the binding of the TFIID complex
(containing TBP and associated TAF proteins) to the TATA box is the initial
stage of basal transcriptional complex assembly in both the stepwise and
holoenzyme models. TFIID therefore constitutes an obvious target for activating molecules. Indeed, early studies indicated that both the recruitment
of TFIID to the promoter and its conformation when bound are affected by
activator molecules. Increased binding of TFIID would evidently result in
enhanced binding of the other components of the basal transcription
complex which bind subsequently. Alternatively, alterations in TFIID configuration might act by improving its ability to recruit these other factors or
by directly enhancing its activity within the assembled basal transcription
complex (Figure 5.42). Such findings are complicated, however, by the fact
that, as discussed in Chapter 4 (Section 4.1) TFIID is a multi-protein complex consisting of the DNA-binding component TBP and a variety of TAFs.
Although there is some evidence that activators can interact directly
with TBP, it is clear that in most circumstances activation requires interaction between the activator and one or more of the TAFs. Thus in many
cases, stimulation of transcription in vitro does not occur with purified TBP

An activator (A) bound to its binding site (ABS) can enhance the

alter the configuration of TFIID, so stimulating its activity either by

alone but only when the full TFIID complex is present, indicating that such
activation requires interaction of the activator and one or more of the TAFs.
Most interestingly, different types of activation domain appear to contact
different TAFs. For example, glutamine-rich activators such as Sp1 can bind
TAFII110, while acidic activators such as VP16 bind TAFII31 (see above) and
multiple activators including proline-rich activators bind to TAFII55. Hence,
different components within TFIID can be targeted by different classes of
activator (Figure 5.43).
The interaction between TAFs and transcriptional activators is further
complicated by the existence of cell type-specific TAFs. For example, B lymphocytes express a form of TAFII130 known as TAFII105, which is not
expressed by other cell types. Similarly, mutation of TAFII250 inhibits the
expression of specific genes involved in the cell cycle, without affecting the
expression of other genes. Hence, different promoters and different cell
types differ in their requirement for different TAFs, paralleling the existence
of different TBP-like factors, which was discussed in Chapter 4 (Section 4.1).
Overall, it is clear that TAFs function as critical intermediaries between
activators and the basal transcription complex. They are therefore often
referred to as co-activators since they do not bind to DNA directly but mediate the effects of DNA-bound activators (see below).

A
As discussed in Chapter 4 (Section 4.1) binding of TFIID and TFIIB allows the
subsequent recruitment of the RNA polymerase itself together with the TFIIF
factor. Interestingly, the repeat-containing C-terminal domain of the largest
subunit of RNA polymerase II, which is involved in transcriptional initiation
and elongation (see Chapter 4, Sections 4.1 and 4.2), is also implicated in
the response to transcriptional activators. Thus, deletion of this region from
RNA polymerase II prevents enhanced transcription in response to transcriptional activators, while increasing the number of repeated elements in
this domain enhances the response to activators.
Despite this however, it is unlikely that activators contact RNA polymerase II directly. Rather, work in yeast and subsequently in mammalian cells
has identified a mediator complex containing over 20 polypeptides. The
C-terminal domain of the RPB1 subunit of RNA polymerase II projects from
the rest of the polymerase, allowing it to interact with the mediator complex,
and this interaction is required for the response to transcriptional activators.
It is clear therefore that activators can act by interacting with the mediator
complex which in turn stimulates RNA polymerase activity (Figure 5.44).
Interestingly, electron microscope analysis of the mediator complex
bound to RNA polymerase II suggests that the mediator partially envelopes
the polymerase. This would allow it to receive signals from activators and
transmit them to the polymerase (Figure 5.45 and Figure 5.46). As with
TFIID, it appears that different classes of activators interact with different
components of the mediator complex. Thus, mutation of different mediator
components affects the response to different transcriptional activators.
It is likely therefore, that the mediator receives signals from a variety of
different transcriptional activators bound to specific target DNA sequences
associated with a particular gene and then interacts with RNA polymerase II
to produce the appropriate level of transcription. Interestingly, various transcription factors that directly repress transcription (see Section 5.3 for

discussion of the mechanisms of transcriptional repression) have also been
shown to interact with the mediator. This leads to the idea that the mediator
integrates the signals coming from both transcriptional activators and transcriptional repressors bound to the target gene and then interacts with RNA
polymerase II to set the appropriate rate of transcription (Figure 5.47).
In addition to the mediator, another multiprotein complex known as
SAGA (Spt-Ada-Gcn5-acetyltransferase) also plays a key role in transcriptional activation. This complex contains components such as TAFs which
can respond to transcriptional activators (see above), as well as components such as the Gcn5 protein which can acetylate histones (see Chapter 2,
Section 2.3). Hence, the SAGA complex can link transcriptional activators to
the basal transcriptional complex and to the production of alterations in
chromatin structure, via acetylation of histones.

Head

A
As discussed above, transcriptional activators often contact their ultimate
targets indirectly, acting for example, via TAFs or the mediator or SAGA
complexes. This has led to the concept of co-activators which do not bind to
DNA themselves but act to transmit the signal from the DNA-bound transcriptional activator to the basal transcriptional complex.
Indeed, co-activators have been identified in a number of different situations involving specific transcriptional activators. Such co-activators are
recruited to the DNA by protein–protein interactions with the DNA-bound
activator and subsequently activate transcription. Perhaps the best known
co-activator is CBP (CREB-binding protein). As its name suggests, CBP was
first defined as a protein that binds to the CREB transcription factor which
activates specific genes in response to cyclic AMP (see Chapter 8, Section
8.2 for further discussion of the cyclic AMP/CRBB system).
Most importantly, CBP only binds to CREB when CREB has been phosphorylated on the amino acid serine at position 133. Since such phosphorylation is necessary for CREB to activate transcription, this indicated that
recruitment of CBP was likely to play a key role in mediating transcriptional
activation by CREB (see Chapter 8, Section 8.2). Hence, CBP does not bind

to DNA itself but is recruited to the gene by DNA-bound phosphorylated

CBP has now been shown to play a key role in mediating transcriptional activation by a number of DNA-binding transcription factors which
are discussed in this book, including the nuclear receptor family (Section
5.1), NFκB (Chapter 8, Section 8.2), p53 (Chapter 11, Section 11.3), and
MyoD (Section 5.1 and Chapter 10, Section 10.1). Hence, it is clear that
CBP and its close relative p300 play a key role as co-activators for a number of transcriptional activators (Figure 5.48). Indeed, the widespread use
of CBP by transcription factors activated by different signaling pathways
may result in competition between these pathways for limited amounts of
CBP. This in turn would account for the phenomenon in which simultaneous stimulation of two different pathways such as those stimulated by glucocorticoid and phorbol esters results in each pathway inhibiting the other,
so that no transcriptional activation occurs (see Chapter 8, Section 8.1 and
Figure 8.12).
Although CBP can interact with members of the nuclear receptor family,
it is not the only co-activator to do so. In several cases, specific co-activators
can bind to the receptors only after hormone treatment. Hence, the binding
of specific co-activators to these receptors only after hormone treatment
allows the receptors to activate transcription in a hormone-dependent manner (see Chapter 8, Section 8.1).
It is likely that co-activators can act to stimulate transcription via at least
two distinct mechanisms, following their recruitment to the DNA by a DNAbound activator. Both these mechanisms have been shown to operate in the
case of CBP. Thus, CBP has been shown to bind to various components of
the basal transcription complex, indicating that it can bridge the gap
between CREB and the basal complex, allowing CREB to activate transcription (Figure 5.49a).
Moreover, as discussed in Chapter 2 (Section 2.3) and Chapter 3 (Section
3.3). CBP also has histone acetyltransferase activity, indicating that it can
also stimulate transcription by acetylating histones and therefore opening
up the chromatin structure (Figure 5.49b). Hence, co-activators can act
either via linking the activator to the basal complex or by modifying chromatin structure.

enhance transcriptional activity by enhancing the assembly of the basal
transcriptional complex or its activity. In addition, from the cases discussed
above it is clear that in some situations such interactions can also alter
chromatin structure. Thus, interaction of activators with the SAGA complex
or the CBP co-activator can lead to chromatin opening by stimulating their
histone acetyltransferase activity.
A clear example of this is seen in the case of the PHO4 transcription
factor in yeast. This factor binds to the PHO5 gene promoter following phosphate starvation and evicts four nucleosomes, allowing subsequent activation of the promoter. Interestingly, removal of the acidic activation domain
of PHO4 prevents this nucleosome eviction following binding of the truncated PHO4 protein. However, the ability to evict nucleosomes can be
restored by linking the activation domain of VP16 to the truncated PHO4
molecule (Figure 5.50).
In this case, the acidic activation domains of PHO4 and VP16 can therefore alter chromatin structure, as well as interact with the basal transcriptional complex. Indeed, in the case of VP16 it has been demonstrated that
it can alter the activity of the SWI/SNF chromatin remodeling complex,
which was discussed in Chapter 3, Section 3.5. Thus, in the absence of
VP16, SWI/SNF can cause nucleosomes to slide along the DNA, whereas
in the presence of VP16 it can drive their actual eviction to produce a
nucleosome-free region, as occurs in the PHO5 promoter.
It is clear therefore that transcriptional activators can produce altered
chromatin structure via factors such as CBP or SAGA components that have
histone acetyltransferase activity and via interaction with complexes that
can remodel chromatin such as SWI/SNF (Figure 5.51).

A
There exists therefore a bewildering array of potential targets for activator
molecules, including the RNA polymerase/mediator complex, co-activators,
chromatin remodeling complexes, and the different components of TFIID.
Indeed, other components of the basal transcriptional complex such as TFIIA,

ACTIVATION OF TRANSCRIPTION

189

TFIIB, TFIIE, and TFIIH have also been observed to interact directly with transcriptional activators. All these various possibilities are not mutually exclusive, however. Thus, it is likely that all these components can act as a target
either for the same activating factor or for different activating factors.
Several possibilities may account for such a wide range of activator targets. For example, it is possible that different organisms differ in the preferred target for transcriptional activators. Indeed, while TAFs associated
with TBP appear to be of critical importance for transcriptional activation in
multicellular organisms such as Drosophila, they may be of much less
importance in yeast. Alternatively, it has been suggested that the sole
requirement for an activator is to be able to bind to DNA and then bind any
component of the basal transcriptional complex and hence recruit it to the
DNA. Thus, an activator can function simply by interacting with any component of the complex and thereby enhancing its binding to the promoter.
It is most probable, however, that a multiplicity of targets for activators
is required to produce the strong synergistic activation of transcription that
is observed when different activating factors are added together compared
with the level observed when each factor is added separately. Thus, in a
number of cases the binding of two transcription factors to different sites in
the promoter can produce very strong activation of transcription, whereas
each factor alone produces much weaker activation (Figure 5.52a).
Similarly, strong enhancement of transcription is observed when multiple
copies of a single factor can bind the target DNA (Figure 5.52b). In turn,
these synergistic effects are likely to play a key role in producing strong
transcriptional activation in response to specific stimuli and/or at specific
stages of embryonic development.
The complexity of the transcription complex allows different activating
factors or different molecules of the same activating factor to contact

191

 REPRESSION OF TRANSCRIPTION

Repressors can act indirectly by inhibiting the positive
effect of activators
The simplest means of achieving repression is for a repressor to prevent an
activating molecule from binding to DNA. This can occur by a negative factor promoting a tightly packed chromatin structure that does not allow activating molecules to bind (Figure 5.54a) (see Chapter 3 for a discussion of
the effect of chromatin structure on gene expression). An example of this
effect was discussed in Section 5.1 in which the polycomb repressor binds
to Drosophila homeotic genes and organizes them into an inactive chromatin structure incapable of binding activators (see Figure 5.9).
Alternatively, the negatively acting factor can bind specifically to the
binding site of the activator, so preventing it from binding (Figure 5.54b).
This effect is seen in the β-interferon promoter, where the binding of several
positively acting factors is necessary for gene activation. Another factor acts
negatively by binding to this region of DNA and simply preventing the positively acting factors from binding. In response to viral infection, the negative
factor is inactivated, allowing the positively acting factors to bind and transcription occurs. A similar example was described in Section 5.1, whereby
the DNA binding of the engrailed gene product inhibits gene activation by
preventing the binding of the Ftz activator protein (see Figure 5.6).
In a related phenomenon (Figure 5.54c) repression is achieved by formation of a complex between the activator and the repressor in solution,
preventing the activator from binding to the DNA. This is seen in the case
of the inhibitory factor Id, which dimerizes with the muscle determining
factor MyoD via its helix-loop-helix motif and prevents it binding to DNA
and activating transcription (see Section 5.1, Figure 5.34, and Chapter 10,
Section 10.1).
In addition to inhibiting DNA binding by these different means, a negative factor can also act by interfering with the activation of transcription
mediated by a bound factor in a phenomenon known as quenching (Figure
5.54d). This can occur by the inhibitory factor binding to DNA adjacent to
the activator (Figure 5.55a). In the case of the promoter driving expression
of the c-myc gene, a negatively acting factor myc-PRF binds to a site adjacent to that occupied by a positively acting factor myc-CF1 and prevents it
from activating c-myc gene expression.
Alternatively this effect can occur by the inhibitor binding to the activator itself and blocking its ability to activate transcription (Figure 5.55b).
This is seen in the case of the MDM4 oncogenic protein, which binds to the
anti-oncogenic p53 protein and masks its activation domain, preventing it
from activating transcription (see Chapter 11, Section 11.3).
As well as blocking DNA binding or transcriptional activation, a repressor can also act by producing the degradation of the activator (Figure 5.54e).
An example of this is the MDM2 oncogenic protein, which rather than
quenching activation by p53 induces the degradation of the p53 protein
thereby preventing it from activating transcription (see Chapter 11, Section
11.3). This effect is achieved indirectly by MDM2 catalyzing the modification
of p53, by the addition of the small protein ubiquitin which targets it for
degradation by protease enzymes (Figure 5.56a). In contrast, the AEBP1
transcription factor which regulates adipocyte differentiation is itself a protease enzyme and therefore can produce transcriptional repression by
directly degrading the activator (Figure 5.56b).

Repressors can act directly by inhibiting the assembly or activity
of the basal transcriptional complex
In all the cases discussed so far the negative factor exerts its inhibitory effect
in an essentially passive or indirect manner by neutralizing the action of a
positively acting factor, by preventing either its DNA binding or its activation
of transcription or by inducing its degradation. It is clear however, that
some factors can have an inherent actively negative action on transcription
that does not depend upon the neutralization of a positively acting factor
(Figure 5.54f ).

For example, the Drosophila eve (even-skipped) protein is able to repress
transcription from a promoter lacking DNA-binding sites for any activating
proteins, indicating that it has a directly negative effect on transcription. A
similar direct inhibitory effect has been observed in the case of the mammalian c-erbA gene which encodes the thyroid hormone receptor, a member of
the nuclear receptor family (see Chapter 4, Section 4.3 and this chapter,
Section 5.1). Thus, the binding of this receptor to its specific DNA-binding
site in the absence of thyroid hormone results in the direct inhibition of
transcription. This effect is mediated by the NCo-R nuclear receptor
co-repressor.
As with co-activators, co-repressors do not bind to DNA but are recruited
by protein–protein interactions with a DNA-bound repressor. The NCo-R
co-repressor binds to the thyroid hormone receptor in the absence of hormone and inhibits transcription of the target gene. In the presence of thyroid hormone however, the receptor undergoes a conformational change
that results in the release of the co-repressor and allows co-activators such
as CBP to bind (see Section 5.2). This then allows the receptor to activate
rather than repress transcription (Figure 5.57).
This example indicates the critical role of co-activators and co-repressors
in regulating gene expression. Thus, thyroid hormone can modulate gene
expression by controlling whether its receptor binds a co-activator or a
co-repressor. Similarly, as discussed in Section 5.1, the different configurations a factor adopts on different DNA-binding sites can alter its effect on
transcription by altering its ability to bind co-activators or co-repressors.
The thyroid hormone receptor example also indicates that the distinction between activators and repressors is not a precise one. In some cases,
the same factor can stimulate or inhibit transcription depending on the circumstances, with this effect being controlled via the regulated recruitment
of co-repressor and co-activator molecules.
Interestingly, two alternative forms of the thyroid hormone receptor
exist which are encoded by alternatively spliced mRNAs. One of these (α-1)
contains the hormone-binding domain and can mediate gene activation in
response to thyroid hormone, while the other form (α-2) contains an alternative amino acid sequence instead of part of this domain (Figure 5.58a).
Therefore the α-2 form cannot respond to the hormone, although since it
contains the DNA-binding domain it can bind to the receptor-binding site in
hormone-responsive genes. By doing so, it prevents binding of the α-1 form
and therefore blocks the induction of the gene in response to thyroid hormone (Figure 5.58b). These two alternatively spliced forms of the transcription factor, which are made in different amounts in different tissues,
therefore mediate opposing effects on thyroid hormone-dependent gene
expression, further reinforcing the dual activator–repressor role of the thyroid hormone receptor.
In a number of directly acting active transcriptional repressors such as
even-skipped and the thyroid hormone repressor, a specific region of the
protein has been shown to be able to confer the ability to inhibit gene
expression upon the DNA-binding domain of another protein when the two

are artificially linked. This clearly parallels the similar behavior of activation
domains in such domain-swap experiments (Section 5.2).
As noted in Chapter 3 (Section 3.3) the nuclear receptor co-repressor
(NCo-R) which binds to the inhibitory domain of the thyroid hormone
receptor associates with the Sin3/RPD3 protein complex which can produce a more tightly packed chromatin structure by deacetylating histones.
Hence, some inhibitory domains function at least in part by recruiting molecules that can alter chromatin structure.
In other cases, however, such inhibitory domains inhibit transcription by
reducing the formation and/or stability of the basal transcriptional complex. This could occur by the inhibitor interacting with the basal transcriptional complex either directly or indirectly via the mediator complex (see
Section 5.2 and Figure 5.47). Alternatively the inhibitor may act by recruiting a co-repressor which then interacts with the basal transcriptional complex or the mediator complex. Such inhibitory domains therefore act in a
manner similar to activation domains but reduce rather than enhance the
rate of transcription.
In considering direct repressors, we have so far considered factors that
produce their effect by binding to DNA and then inhibiting transcription
either by directly or indirectly interacting with the basal transcriptional complex to inhibit its activity or by altering chromatin structure (Figure 5.59a).
Indeed, the binding of the thyroid hormone receptor to the silencer element
in the chicken lysozyme gene is responsible for the inhibitory effect of this
DNA sequence (see Chapter 4, Section 4.4).
In other cases however, active inhibitory factors can bind directly to the
basal transcriptional complex and inhibit its activity (Figure 5.59b). One
example of this is the Dr1 factor, which binds to TBP and prevents TFIIB
from binding (Figure 5.60a), thereby preventing assembly of the basal
transcriptional complex on TATA box-containing promoters (see Chapter
4, Section 4.1). The assembly of the basal complex is also inhibited by
binding of the Mot1 factor. Like Dr1, the Mot1 factor also targets TBP but
rather than inhibiting the binding of TFIIB, it displaces TBP from the DNA
(Figure 5.60b).
Interestingly, the TFIIA factor, which was described in Chapter 4 (Section
4.1) appears to act by binding to TFIID and preventing the binding of Dr1
and Mot1, thereby promoting the binding of TFIIB and preventing TBP being
displaced from the DNA. In agreement with this idea, the requirement for
TFIIA in artificially reconstituted “test tube” transcription systems disappears

as TFIID is purified away from these inhibitory molecules, whereas it plays a
key role in the cell where these inhibitors are present.
Overall therefore, inhibitory factors are likely to play a critical role in the
regulation of transcription, both by inhibiting the activity of positively acting
factors and in other cases by having a direct inhibitory effect on transcription (see Figure 5.54). Hence, the balance between positively and negatively
acting factors, both within the basal transcriptional complex and bound to
specific DNA-binding sites, will play a key role in determining the transcription rate of a particular gene in different circumstances.

5.4

RegULaTION aT TRaNSCRIpTIONaL
eLONgaTION

Regulation of transcription can occur at the elongation
stage, as well as at initiation
In many cases where increased transcription of a particular gene has been
demonstrated, it is likely that such increased transcription is mediated by
an increased rate of initiation of transcription by RNA polymerase caused
by the action of the positively acting transcription factors that were
described in Section 5.2. Hence, in a tissue in which a gene is being actively
transcribed, a large number of polymerase molecules will be moving along
the gene at any particular time, resulting in the production of a large number of transcripts. Such a series of nascent transcripts being produced from
a single transcription unit can be visualized in the lampbrush chromosomes of amphibian oocytes, the nascent transcripts associated with each
RNA polymerase molecule increasing in length the further the polymerase
has proceeded along the gene, resulting in the characteristic nested
“Christmas tree” appearance (Figure 5.61).
By contrast, in tissues where a gene is transcribed at very low levels,
initiation of transcription will be a rare event and only one or a very few
polymerase molecules will be transcribing a gene at any particular time.
Similarly, the absence of transcription of a particular gene in some tissues
will result from a failure of RNA polymerase to initiate transcription in that
tissue (Figure 5.62).
Although many cases of transcriptional regulation are likely to occur at
the level of initiation, the existence of RNA polymerase pausing 30–40
nucleotides after initiating transcription, which was discussed in Chapter 4
(Section 4.2), clearly offers the possibility for control at the level of transcriptional elongation. In such cases, transcriptional control can operate by
releasing a block to elongation of the nascent transcript.

 REGULATION AT TRANSCRIPTIONAL ELONGATION
Such regulation at the level of polymerase pausing appears to be particularly widespread in genes that are the targets for activation by specific
signaling pathways. Therefore, it has been proposed that regulation of transcriptional elongation may function as a means of coordinating the expression of a number of different genes, so that they can all begin transcription
and undergo pausing independently but then are activated coordinately by
the appropriate signal that releases the paused polymerase (Figure 5.63a).
Similarly, pausing could represent a means of ensuring that transcription of
a gene is activated only in response to a combination of two signals. Where
such signals are received at different times, the first may stimulate transcriptional initiation but the release of the paused polymerase will require the
second signal (Figure 5.63b).
Interestingly, highly regulated genes of this type will have a tightly
packed chromatin structure when they are inactive with nucleosomes
occupying the promoter (see Chapter 3, Section 3.5). The initial phase of
transcription will require the displacement of such nucleosomes, allowing
transcriptional initiation to occur. It has been proposed that promoter pausing allows the polymerase to block the recruitment of nucleosomes to
the promoter, so stabilizing its nucleosome-free structure until further

molecules of RNA polymerase have been recruited, ensuring a high level of
gene transcription (Figure 5.63c). It is likely that each of these mechanisms operates either independently or with the other mechanism(s) at
genes exhibiting promoter pausing.
Interestingly, regulation of polymerase pausing has recently been shown
to occur for a number of genes encoding regulatory factors which are themselves involved in cellular signaling pathways, such as the transcription factor NFκB and components of the MAP kinase pathway (see Chapter 8 for
discussion of cellular signaling pathways and their role in the regulation of
gene expression).
Regulation at the level of transcriptional elongation has been well characterized in the case of the gene encoding the c-Myc transcription factor
(for discussion of c-Myc see Chapter 11, Sections 11.1 and 11.2), where it is
responsible for the 10-fold decline in c-Myc mRNA levels that occurs when
the human pro-myeloid cell line HL-60 is induced to differentiate into a
granulocyte type cell. If nuclear run-on assays (see Chapter 1, Section 1.4)
are carried out using nuclei from undifferentiated or differentiated HL-60
cells, the results obtained vary depending on the region of the c-myc gene
whose transcription is being measured. The c-myc gene consists of three
exons, which appear in the messenger RNA and which are separated by
intervening sequences that are removed from the primary transcript by RNA
splicing. If the labeled products of the nuclear run-on procedure are hybridized to the DNA of the second exon, the levels of transcription observed are
approximately 10-fold higher in nuclei derived from undifferentiated cells
than in nuclei from differentiated cells.
Hence the observed differences in c-myc RNA levels in these cell types
are indeed produced by differences in transcription rates. However, if the
same labeled products are hybridized to DNA from the first exon of the
c-myc gene, virtually no difference in the level of transcription of this region
in the differentiated compared to the undifferentiated cells is observed.
Comparison of the rates of transcription of the first and second exons in
undifferentiated and differentiated cells indicates that regulation takes place
at the level of transcriptional elongation rather than initiation. Although similar numbers of polymerase molecules initiate transcription of the c-myc gene
in both cell types, the majority terminate in differentiated cells near the end of
exon 1, do not transcribe the remainder of the gene, and hence do not produce a functional RNA. In contrast, in undifferentiated cells most polymerase
molecules that initiate transcription transcribe the whole gene and produce a
functional RNA. Thus the fall in c-Myc RNA in differentiated cells is regulated
by means of a block to elongation of nascent transcripts (Figure 5.64).
One of the first proteins affecting the rate of transcriptional elongation
was identified in the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV-1). Early in infection with this virus, a low level of transcription occurs from the HIV-1 promoter and many of the transcripts terminate very close to the promoter,
producing very short RNAs. Subsequently, the viral Tat protein binds to
these HIV-1 RNAs at a region known as Tar which is located at +19 to +42
relative to the start site of transcription at nucleotide +1. This binding produces two effects. First, there is a large increase in transcriptional initiation,

The HIV Tat protein acts both by enhancing
the rate of transcriptional initiation by rNA
polymerase (pol II) and by enhancing the rate
of elongation by overcoming polymerase
pausing close to the promoter. Both these
effects are achieved by the Tat protein
binding to a specific region (Tar) of the
nascent rNA. Arrows indicate nascent HIV

leading to many more RNA transcripts being initiated. In addition, however,
Tat also overcomes the block to elongation leading to the production of a
greater proportion of long transcripts that can encode the viral proteins.
Tat therefore produces a large increase in the production of HIV transcripts able to encode viral proteins both by stimulating transcriptional initiation and by overcoming a block to transcriptional elongation close to the
promoter (Figure 5.65). As well as the viral Tat protein, a number of cellular proteins that can stimulate transcriptional elongation have also been
identified (see below). Indeed many transcriptional activators have been
shown to act by stimulating both transcriptional initiation and elongation
and both these effects are dependent upon their transcriptional activation
domains which were described earlier (Section 5.2).

Factors which regulate transcriptional elongation target the
C-terminal domain of the RpB1 subunit of RNa polymerase II
A key target for factors which regulate transcriptional elongation is the phosphorylation of the C-terminal domain (CTD) of the RPB1 subunit of RNA polymerase II. As described in Chapter 4 (Section 4.2), such phosphorylation of
the CTD on serine 2 is a key event required for transcriptional elongation by
RNA polymerase II. Interestingly, the HIV Tat protein has been shown to be
able to recruit the pTEF-b kinase protein which phosphorylates the CTD on
serine 2, allowing transcriptional elongation to occur. Hence, Tat attracts this
kinase to the HIV promoter, ensuring phosphorylation of RNA polymerase II
and stimulating transcriptional elongation (Figure 5.66). Interestingly, TAT

recruits pTEF-b as part of a multiprotein complex known as the super elongation complex (SEC). This complex not only contains pTEF-b but pTEF-b
is more active within the SEC than when present alone (Figure 5.67a).
In contrast, in the case of the c-myc gene discussed above it has been
shown that the mediator complex (see Section 5.2) recruits the SEC containing active pTEF-b (Figure 5.67b). This indicates that the SEC plays a
key role in stimulating transcriptional elongation of cellular as well as viral
genes and that the mediator complex can act to stimulate transcriptional
elongation as well as transcriptional initiation.
The involvement of CTD phosphorylation in regulating transcriptional
elongation is also seen in the case of the zebrafish protein, Foggy. The
Foggy protein interacts with the nonphosphorylated form of RNA polymerase II to block transcriptional elongation. However, when RNA polymerase
II is phosphorylated, it is no longer inhibited by Foggy, allowing transcriptional elongation to proceed (Figure 5.68). When this activity of Foggy is
inactivated by mutation, the resulting zebrafish fail to produce the correct
number of dopamine-synthesizing neurons during development. This indicates that the regulation of transcriptional elongation by Foggy is likely to
be critical for the correct expression of genes involved in the production of
this cell type. Moreover, it more generally demonstrates that regulation at
the level of transcriptional elongation can play a key role in controlling
gene expression during development.
The SEC and the Foggy protein examples indicate that cellular regulators
of transcriptional elongation can act to either stimulate or inhibit this process. Indeed, in yeast a pair of antagonistic regulators of transcriptional
elongation have been identified. The Fkh2p factor stimulates transcriptional
elongation and processing of the RNA by enhancing phosphorylation of the
CTD of the RPB1 subunit of RNA polymerase II on serine 2 and serine 5. In
contrast, Fkhlp inhibits such phosphorylation and thereby inhibits transcriptional elongation (Figure 5.69).
Hence, transcriptional elongation is regulated by the balance between
factors that stimulate elongation of the transcript and those that inhibit it. As

many of these factors regulate transcriptional elongation by controlling the
phosphorylation of the CTD of the RPB1 subunit of RNA polymerase II, they
also regulate post-transcriptional processes which are regulated by such
phosphorylation (Figure 5.69), thereby linking RNA transcript production
with its proper processing (see Chapter 6, Section 6.4 for discussion of the
linkage of transcription with post-transcriptional events and the role of the
CTD in these processes).

RegULaTION OF TRaNSCRIpTION BY RNa
pOLYMeRaSeS I aND III

In this chapter, we have discussed the very wide range of transcription factors that regulate transcriptional initiation and elongation by RNA polymerase II, paralleling the very wide variety of patterns of expression of genes
transcribed by RNA polymerase II. The much simpler patterns of expression
of genes transcribed by RNA polymerases I and III (see Chapter 4, Section
4.1) are paralleled by their relatively simpler regulation.

Transcription by RNa polymerases I and III can be regulated
by altering the expression or activity of components of their
basal transcriptional complexes
In a number of situations, transcription by RNA polymerases I and III is regulated by altering either the expression level or the activity of the basal
transcription factors which are involved in the expression of all the genes
transcribed by these particular polymerases (Figure 5.70). This is evidently
possible because these polymerases predominantly transcribe genes
involved in ribosome production. They can therefore be regulated more
globally than RNA polymerase II, which transcribes a wide range of genes
involved in different cellular functions.
An example of the altered activity of basal transcription factors (Figure
5.70a) occurs during mitosis when the transcription of the ribosomal
genes is inhibited by regulating the activity of the basal transcription factors
UBF and SL1/TIF-1B, which are essential for transcription by RNA polymerase I (see Chapter 4, Section 4.1). Thus, upon entry into mitosis both
factors are phosphorylated, which decreases their activity and blocks transcription of the ribosomal genes by RNA polymerase I. After the cell completes mitosis, both factors are dephosphorylated and this activates SL1.
However, ribosomal gene transcription does not occur until entry into the
G1 phase of the next cell cycle, since it also requires phosphorylation of
UBF on a different region of the protein, which is necessary for its activation (Figure 5.71).

Following mitosis both factors are dephosphorylated which
activates Sl1. Subsequently, UBF is phosphorylated on a
different region of the protein which activates it and allows
transcription to occur during the cell cycle.

Chapter 5: Transcription Factors and Transcriptional Control

As well as being regulated as cells proceed through the cell cycle and
mitosis, enhanced activity of RNA polymerase I as well as of RNA polymerase III is required in growing cells compared with resting cells. Thus, as
discussed in Chapter 11 (Sections 11.3 and 11.5), anti-oncogene proteins
restrain cellular growth by inhibiting the activity of specific basal transcription factors for RNA polymerases I and III. In contrast, the c-Myc
oncogenic transcription factor has the opposite effect and stimulates the
activity of these factors, thus enhancing RNA polymerase I- and IIIdependent transcription and stimulating cellular growth (see Chapter 11,
Section 11.5).
Interestingly, the fact that the TBP factor is involved in transcription by
all three RNA polymerases (see Chapter 4, Section 4.1) appears to be used
to regulate the balance between transcription by the different RNA polymerases. As discussed in Section 5.3, the Dr1 inhibitory factor binds to TBP
and inhibits its ability to recruit other transcription factors to TATA
box-containing RNA polymerase II gene promoters. Interestingly, Dr1 also
affects recruitment to RNA polymerase III promoters but has no effect on
the activity of TBP within the RNA polymerase I transcriptional complex.
Hence Dr1 may regulate the balance between transcription of the ribosomal RNA genes, which are the only genes transcribed by RNA polymerase
I, and all the other genes in the cell (Figure 5.72a).
Dr1 also appears to selectively inhibit transcription of polymerase II
genes which have a TATA box, while actually stimulating transcription of
genes containing an initiator element (see Chapter 4, Sections 4.1 and 4.3,
for discussion of the TATA box and initiator elements). Hence, Dr1 may also
switch transcription between different classes of RNA polymerase
II-transcribed genes (Figure 5.72b).
As well as being regulated by altering the activity of individual basal
transcription factors, the activity of RNA polymerase III is also regulated in
specific situations by altering the expression levels of its basal transcription factors (see Chapter 4, Section 4.1) (Figure 5.70b). Thus the activation
of genes transcribed by RNA polymerase III following treatment of cells
with serum is due to enhanced levels of active TFIIIC, whereas the
down-regulation of polymerase III transcription during the differentiation
of embryonic stem (ES) cells is due to a decrease in TFIIIB levels (see
Chapter 9, Section 9.1 for further discussion of gene regulation in ES cells).

Regulation of transcription by RNa polymerase III can involve
specific transcription factors binding to RNa as well as to DNa
As with RNA polymerase II, the regulatory processes discussed above
involve factors that exert their effects on RNA polymerase I- and RNA polymerase III-mediated gene expression by binding at the DNA level. In addition however, in the case of RNA polymerase III, the presence of
transcriptional control elements within the transcribed region (see Chapter
4, Section 4.1) and hence in both the DNA and the RNA product, offers
another potential mechanism of gene regulation. This is exploited in a
unique regulatory mechanism involving the basal transcription factor
TFIIIA, which binds to the internal regulatory sequence of the 5S ribosomal
RNA genes (see also Section 5.1).
Thus, the frog Xenopus laevis contains two types of 5S rRNA genes: the
oocyte genes which are transcribed only in the developing oocyte before
fertilization, and the somatic genes which are transcribed in cells of the
embryo and adult. The internal DNA control region of both these types of
genes bind TFIIIA, whose binding is necessary for their transcription (see
Chapter 4, Section 4.1). However, sequence differences between the two
types of gene (Figure 5.73) result in a higher affinity of the TFIIIA factor for

The Dr1 factor inhibits the activity of TBP
within the basal transcription complex of
genes transcribed by rNA polymerase II and
III but not in that of the ribosomal rNA genes
which are transcribed by rNA polymerase
I. Hence Dr1 may regulate the balance
between the transcription of ribosomal
genes by rNA polymerase I and that of all
other genes in the cell by rNA polymerases
II and III (a). In addition Dr1 also stimulates
genes transcribed by rNA polymerase II that
contain an initiator element, while repressing
those which contain a TATA box. Hence, it
can switch transcription between different
classes of genes transcribed by rNA
polymerase II (b).

 REGULATION OF TRANSCRIPTION BY RNA POLYMERASES I AND III
the somatic compared with the oocyte genes. Hence, the oocyte genes are
only transcribed in the oocyte where there are abundant levels of TFIIIA and
not in other cells where the levels of TFIIIA are only sufficient for activation
of the somatic genes.
In the developing oocyte, TFIIIA is synthesized at high levels and transcription of the oocyte genes (as well as the somatic genes) begins. As more
and more 5S rRNA molecules containing the TFIIIA-binding site accumulate
in the maturing oocyte, they bind the transcription factor. This factor is thus
sequestered with the 5S rRNA into storage particles and is unavailable for
transcription of the 5S rRNA genes. Hence the level of free transcription
factor falls below that necessary for the transcription of the oocyte genes
and their transcription ceases, while transcription of the higher affinity
somatic genes is unaffected (Figure 5.74).
A simple mechanism involving differential binding of a transcription factor to two related genes is thus used in conjunction with the binding of the
same factor to its RNA product, to modulate expression of the 5S rRNA
genes.

Transcription by RNA polymerases I and III can be regulated
by alterations in chromatin structure
Interestingly, as with RNA polymerase II, transcription by RNA polymerases
I and III can be regulated by changes in chromatin structure. Thus, in yeast,
glucose starvation leads to a reduction in ribosome production. This is
achieved by the silencing of the ribosomal RNA genes by their packaging
into the tightly packed chromatin structure, known as heterochromatin (see
Chapter 2, Section 2.5). This is achieved by a multiprotein complex (known
as eNoSc, energy-dependent nucleolar silencing complex), which
deacetylates histone H3 and also modifies lysine 9 of this histone by dimethylation, both of which are modifications characteristic of tightly packed
chromatin (see Chapter 3, Section 3.3) (Figure 5.75).
It is likely that changes in chromatin structure also play an important
role in the transcription by RNA polymerase III of genes encoding the tRNAs.
Evidently, each cell must express a variety of tRNAs which together are
capable of binding all 20 different amino acids and delivering them to the
ribosome so that protein synthesis can occur. As discussed in Chapter 6
(Section 6.6), due to the redundancy of the genetic code, several different
codons within the mRNA can specify the same amino acid. In turn, several
different tRNAs able to bind a specific amino acid exist with the different
tRNAs having different anticodons corresponding to the different codons
in the mRNA which can specify that amino acid.
It has been demonstrated that the different tRNAs for a specific amino
acid can be differentially expressed in different cell types. This provides an
example of cell type-specific expression of genes transcribed by RNA polymerase III, in contrast to the more global regulatory processes we have discussed so far for RNA polymerases I and III. This effect appears to involve
both the c-Myc protein and alterations in chromatin structure. Thus, ChIP
assays (see Chapter 4, Section 4.3) have demonstrated that c-Myc is bound
to tRNA genes which are active in a specific cell type. Moreover, c-Myc
bound to tRNA genes has been shown to recruit the GCN5 histone acetyltransferase, which acetylates histone H3 and thereby opens the chromatin
structure so that transcription can occur (Figure 5.76) (see Chapter 2,
Section 2.3, and Chapter 3, Section 3.3 for discussion of histone acetylation
and its role in the regulation of chromatin structure).
This example demonstrates that c-Myc is involved in regulating the
chromatin structure of genes transcribed by RNA polymerase III as well as
interacting with the basal transcription factors for this polymerase (see
above). Moreover, it indicates that regulation of transcription by RNA polymerase III is more complex than previously thought, involving not only
global regulatory processes affecting all genes transcribed by this polymerase but also cell type-specific differential regulation of different polymerase
III transcribed genes.

CONCLUSIONS
The findings discussed in this chapter indicate the key roles played by specific transcription factors in the activation and repression of transcription;
such factors can act at the levels of transcriptional initiation and transcriptional elongation by RNA polymerase, as well as by modulating chromatin
structure. The ability to bind to DNA and/or other proteins and then stimulate or repress transcription, allows transcription factors to play key roles in
a wide range of biological processes. Chapters 8–10 will discuss, respectively, the gene control processes that occur in response to specific signals,
during embryonic development and in different types of differentiated cells,
in all of which transcription factors play a key role.

KeY CONCepTS
•

DNA sequences that affect the rate of transcription by RNA
polymerase II act by binding regulatory proteins known as
transcription factors.

•

Transcription factors have a modular structure in which different
domains of the protein are responsible for different functions, such
as DNA binding or transcriptional activation.

•

A number of different DNA-binding domains have been identified
and used to classify transcription factors into families with related
DNA-binding domains.

•

Individual transcription factors bind to specific DNA sequences but
their DNA-binding specificity can be affected by the presence or
absence of other regulatory proteins with which they interact.

•

Following DNA binding, transcription factors can either activate or
repress transcription.

•

Specific activation domains in transcription factors activate
transcription by altering the structure of chromatin or by
stimulating the assembly/activity of the basal transcription
complex, with these effects occurring either directly or indirectly
via co-activators.

•

Inhibitory transcription factors can repress transcription either
indirectly by blocking the effect of a positively acting factor or
directly either by altering chromatin structure or via the basal
transcriptional complex and co-repressors.

FIgURe 5.76
Differential expression of two different trNA
genes in different cell types. trNAs 1 and
2 both bind the same amino acid but have
different anticodons (A and B) which are
able to recognize different codons specifying
that amino acid in the mrNA. The gene
encoding trNA1 is expressed in cell type
1 and that encoding trNA2 in cell type 2.
This differential expression is controlled by
binding of the Myc protein which in turn
recruits the GcN5 histone acetyltransferase.
GcN5 then acetylates histone H3, producing
an open chromatin structure of the active
gene in each cell type.

Post-transcriptional Processes

INTRODUCTION
The transcription of DNA into RNA represents the first stage in the process
of gene expression (Chapter 4) and is the major control point regulating
which genes are expressed (Chapter 5). However, the process of transcription is supplemented by a series of post-transcriptional events that are necessary to produce a functional mRNA which is able to be translated into
protein (Figure 6.1).
Even while transcription is still proceeding, the nascent RNA is capped
at its 5′ end by a modified guanosine residue and is cleaved near its 3′ end,
followed by addition of up to 200 adenosine residues in a process known as
polyadenylation. In addition, intervening sequences or introns (which interrupt the protein-coding sequence in both the DNA and the primary transcript of many genes) are removed by a process of RNA splicing.
These various post-transcriptional processes all occur in the nucleus
and do not necessarily take place in the simple sequence illustrated in
Figure 6.1. For example, the removal of intervening sequences can occur
either before or after polyadenylation has occurred. Moreover, all these processes are closely coupled with one another and with the process of transcription itself (see Section 6.4).
Taken together, these post-transcriptional processes produce a functional mRNA, within the nucleus. This fully spliced RNA molecule must then
be transported from the nucleus to the cytoplasm where it can be translated
into protein.
As each of these stages in gene expression is essential for the production
of a functional mRNA, they could potentially be a target for control processes which regulate gene expression. Accordingly, post-transcriptional
processes are described in this chapter and their role in regulating gene
expression is discussed in Chapter 7.

The capping process modifies the 5′ end of the RNA transcript
Following initiation of the primary RNA transcript, transcription proceeds by
the progressive addition of ribonucleotides to the RNA chain so that an RNA
molecule is produced with bases complementary to those present in the
DNA being transcribed. Even before this process is complete, the 5′ end of
the nascent mRNA is modified by the addition of a guanine residue which is
not encoded by the DNA. The bond joining this guanine to the 5′ end of the
RNA differs from the standard bonds linking the nucleotides in the RNA
chain in two ways. First, three phosphate molecules separate the G residue
from the first base in the chain whereas only a single phosphate separates
each residue in the rest of the chain. Second, the phosphate residues are

joined via a 5′ to 5′ bond rather than the standard 3′ to 5′ bond which links
the nucleotides in the chain (Figure 6.2).
This addition of an extra G residue by a 5′–5′ bond is achieved by the
enzyme guanylyl transferase. Subsequently, the enzyme guanine methyltransferase adds a methyl group to position 7 of the purine ring of the added
G residue to produce 7-methyl guanine (Figure 6.2 and Figure 6.3).
This basic cap structure is found in yeast whereas in higher eukaryotes
further modifications can occur with additional methyl residues being added
to the first and sometimes also the second of the two transcribed nucleotides immediately following the 7-methyl guanine. These methyl residues
are added at the 2′ hydroxyl group on the ribose sugar component of the
nucleotide (Figure 6.2).

Capping occurs only in eukaryotes and not in prokaryotes. It is believed to
be necessary due to a difference in the process of translation between
eukaryotic and prokaryotic mRNAs (see Section 6.6). Prokaryotic mRNAs
are in general polycistronic, which means that several different proteins
are translated from the same mRNA. The ribosome can initiate translation
to produce protein internally within an mRNA molecule, being guided by
specific sequences (Shine-Dalgarno sequences) within the mRNA which
are complementary to the 16S RNA of the small ribosomal subunit. In contrast, eukaryotic mRNAs are generally monocistronic with only one protein being derived from each mRNA. These mRNAs therefore lack the guide
sequences present in prokaryotic mRNAs and translation is initiated by the
small (40S) subunit of the ribosome binding to the 5′ end of the mRNA by
recognizing the methylated cap (Figure 6.4).
Interestingly, in prokaryotes the Shine-Dalgarno sequence which is recognized by the 16S ribosomal RNA is located within 10 bases upstream of

FIGURe 6.4
Translational initiation in prokaryotes (a) and
eukaryotes (b). Note that prokaryotic mRNAs
are polycistronic with several proteins
being translated from a single mRNA.
Initiation is achieved by the 16S RNA of
the ribosome binding to a complementary
sequence known as the Shine-Dalgarno (SD)
sequence at various points within the mRNA
molecule. Translation is then initiated at an
AUG codon adjacent to the Shine-Dalgarno
sequence. In contrast, eukaryotic mRNAs
are monocistronic with only a single protein
being translated from the mRNA. Translation
is initiated by the ribosome binding to the
cap structure at the 5′ end of the mRNA
and moving along the mRNA to initiate
translation at an AUG codon, which is located
in an appropriate surrounding sequence.

207

 CAPPING
the AUG sequence at which translation is initiated (see Section 6.6). In contrast, in eukaryotes the AUG initiation codon may be located several hundred bases away from the 5′ end of the RNA. Following binding at the cap,
the 40S subunit of the ribosome migrates along the mRNA until it encounters the appropriate AUG initiation codon. At this point the large (60S) ribosomal subunit binds and translation begins.
However, translation is not initiated at the first AUG that is encountered
by the small ribosomal subunit. Rather, the AUG triplet must be set within
the appropriate consensus sequence, which is related to GCCRCCAUGG
(R = purine, i.e. A or G). This so-called scanning hypothesis, in which the
ribosome moves along the mRNA looking for this sequence, was originally
propounded by Kozak. The rules which determine whether a particular
sequence surrounding an AUG codon will allow the ribosome to initiate
transcription are known as Kozak’s rules.
In eukaryotes, it is therefore necessary for the 5′ end of mRNAs which
are to be translated to be recognized by the translational apparatus and
distinguished from the much more abundant nontranslated RNAs, such as
the ribosomal RNAs. This is achieved by specifically modifying the RNAs to
be translated by the capping process. As the first step of translation, the cap
on the mRNA is recognized by the translational initiation factor eIF4E. As
discussed in Section 6.6, this results in the recruitment of other translation
initiation factors and of the small ribosomal subunit itself.
As well as its function in allowing recognition by the ribosome, the cap
structure also has an important role in protecting the 5′ end of the mRNA
from attack by exonuclease enzymes which would otherwise recognize a
free 5′ end and would digest the RNA in a 5′ to 3′ direction. Indeed, as discussed in Section 6.7, the removal of the cap structure is one of the steps in
mRNA degradation by which the mRNA molecule is ultimately broken
down.
This protection from degradation is achieved in two ways. First, the
unusual nucleotide structure of the cap protects it from 5′ exonuclease
enzymes which would normally degrade an RNA beginning at a standard
free 5′ end. Second, protection from degradation is also achieved by the
binding to the cap of the cap-binding complex (CBC). CBC binds to the
capped RNA in the nucleus, protects it from degradation and facilitates
its transport to the cytoplasm. Following transport to the cytoplasm, CBC
is displaced from the cap by eIF4E allowing the mRNA to be translated
into protein (Figure 6.5). Interestingly, eIF4E and CBC both use similar
structural motifs to bind to the cap, with the 7-methyl guanine ring being
stacked between two aromatic amino acids in a cap-binding pocket of
the protein (Figure 6.6).
More recently, a further role for capping has been described involving
it acting as a checkpoint regulating elongation of the RNA transcript. As
described in Chapter 4 (Section 4.2), following initiation and production
of the first few nucleotides of the RNA, the RNA polymerase pauses and it
is at this point that the RNA is capped. Once capping has occurred, the
pTEF-b kinase is recruited and it phosphorylates RNA polymerase II, so
that transcription continues and the full RNA transcript is produced.
Hence, a checkpoint mechanism operates in which a full RNA transcript
is not produced unless the RNA is correctly capped (Figure 6.7). The
coupling of transcriptional and post-transcriptional processes is discussed further in Section 6.4.

POLYADeNYLATION

The polyadenylation process modifies the 3′ end of the RNA
transcript
As discussed above, the 5′ end of the mRNA differs from that of the primary
transcript only by the addition of the single modified G residue forming the
cap. In contrast however, at the 3′ end, the mRNA molecule is much shorter
than the original transcript and differs from it in terminating with a run of
up to 200 adenosine residues which are added post-transcriptionally in a
process known as polyadenylation (Figure 6.8). This process involves
firstly the cleavage of the RNA transcript and then the subsequent addition
of the A residues at the resulting free 3′ end.
The site at which cleavage occurs (the polyadenylation site) is usually
flanked by two conserved sequence elements (Figure 6.9). Upstream of the
poly(A) site, the RNA contains the essentially invariant sequence AAUAAA
and downstream of the poly(A) site it contains a less well-conserved region
which is rich in G and U residues. These two sequence elements are recognized, respectively, by two protein complexes known as the cleavage and
polyadenylation specificity factor (CPSF) and the cleavage stimulation factor CstF (Figure 6.9). Following the binding of these complexes they are
thought to interact with one another and the cutting of the RNA occurs in
the region between them. Note that this cutting is an endonucleolytic cleavage where cutting occurs within the RNA chain rather than the exonucleolytic cleavage that would occur following removal of the cap (see Section
6.1 above) where degradation begins at a free end of the RNA molecule.
Subsequent to cleavage, the enzyme poly(A) polymerase then adds the
run of A residues to the free 3′ end (Figure 6.9).

Polyadenylation enhances the stability of the mRNA
The RNA transcript is therefore modified at both ends, firstly by capping at
the 5′ end and subsequently by cleavage and polyadenylation at the 3′ end.
It is believed that the primary role of the polyadenylation process is to protect the mRNA from degradation. Thus, the poly(A) tail binds a protein
known as the poly(A) tail-binding protein. The complex of this protein and
the poly(A) tail protects the polyadenylated RNA from degradation by exonucleases which would otherwise attack its free 3′ end and rapidly degrade
it. In many cases, an mRNA which is to be degraded is first deadenylated,
allowing its 3′ end to be attacked (see Section 6.7). In addition, it appears
that the presence of the poly(A) tail can also regulate the efficiency by which
an mRNA is translated. Hence like the cap, the poly(A) tail appears to have
a dual function in regulating both translation of the mRNA into protein and
its degradation.
Interestingly, not all mRNAs encoding proteins are polyadenylated. In
particular, the mRNAs encoding the histone molecules which play a critical
role in chromatin structure are not polyadenylated. In this case however,

Degradation

the 3′ end of the mRNA is protected from degradation since it can fold itself
into a double-stranded stem-loop structure which protects the mRNA from
degradation. Interestingly, the folding and unfolding of this stem loop plays
a critical role in regulating the stability of the histone mRNA. For example,
the histone mRNA becomes highly stable during S phase of the cell cycle
when DNA is being synthesized and more histones are required, while being
unstable at other points of the cell cycle.
However, such an example is the exception and the vast majority of RNA
species transcribed by RNA polymerase II are polyadenylated at their 3′ ends
following capping at the 5′ end. Indeed, even the mRNAs encoding the
minor isoforms of the histones, such as H3.3 and H2A.Z (see Chapter 2,
Section 2.3) are polyadenylated and consequently do not exhibit decreased
stability at phases of the cell cycle outside S phase (Figure 6.10).

RNA SPLICING

RNA splicing removes intervening sequences and joins
exons together
Probably the most unexpected finding to have been made during the modern era of gene cloning was the discovery that the protein-coding regions of
genes transcribed by RNA polymerase II are interrupted by DNA sequences
which do not encode parts of the protein. These intervening sequences are
known as introns because although they are transcribed into RNA, their
RNA product remains in the nucleus whereas the coding regions or exons
exit the nucleus.
When the DNA is transcribed, both the exons and the introns which lie
between them are transcribed into a single primary RNA transcript. As well
as being modified at its 5′ and 3′ ends by capping and polyadenylation, this
primary transcript must therefore also have its introns removed before it is
transported to the cytoplasm. Otherwise, if it is translated, irrelevant amino
acid sequences will appear in the middle of the protein or translation will be
prematurely terminated due to the presence of a stop codon within the
intervening sequence. The process whereby these introns are removed is
known as RNA splicing (Figure 6.11).
Initial studies on RNA splicing concentrated on a DNA sequence analysis
of the introns and the adjacent regions of the exons. Such studies revealed
that the great majority of eukaryotic introns for genes transcribed by RNA
polymerase II begin with the bases GU and end with the bases AG (see
Figure 6.12). Although other features of the intron and the adjacent regions
of the exon have been defined, such as a run of pyrimidine residues (the
polypyrimidine tract) located adjacent to the AG sequence within the
intron, these are much less well conserved than the GU/AG sequences.
Although this finding was of interest, it did not of itself provide any functional insights into the mechanisms by which splicing occurred. These were
initially provided by studies using nuclear extracts which could carry out the
splicing reaction in the test tube. These experiments showed that when a
simple RNA molecule containing two exons interrupted by an intron was
added to the splicing reaction, it was possible to produce the spliced product
with the two exons joined together and a free intron. Most interestingly
however, the intron emerged in a lariat structure in which its 5′ end had
folded back on itself and formed a 5′ to 2′ bond with an A residue located
between 18 and 40 bases upstream of the AG sequence at the 3′ end of the
intron (Figure 6.13). This A residue is known as the branch point.
This can be explained on the basis that splicing proceeds in two transesterification steps (Figure 6.13). In the first of these, the ester bond between
the 5′ phosphate of the intron and the 3′ oxygen of the upstream exon is
exchanged for an ester bond between the 5′ phosphate of the intron and the
2′ oxygen of the branch point A residue. In the second reaction, the ester
bond between the 5′ phosphate of the downstream exon and the 3′ oxygen
of the intron is exchanged for an ester bond between the 5′ phosphate of the
downstream exon and the free 3′ oxygen of the upstream exon. This joins
the upstream exon to the downstream exon and releases the intron as a
lariat (Figure 6.13). The reaction has now achieved its purpose by removing
the intron from between the two exons and joining them together in a splicing reaction.

Specific RNAs and proteins catalyze the process of RNA splicing
within the spliceosome
In considering this process, one might ask why the upstream exon does not
simply diffuse away while the downstream exon is still linked to the intron
and cannot be joined to it. The answer to this question is that this reaction
does not take place with the RNA isolated within the nucleus. Rather it takes
place in a complex structure known as the spliceosome which consists of
five different RNAs and over a hundred proteins, which together catalyze
this process and hold the various intermediates in the splicing process in the

correct orientation relative to one another. The three-dimensional structure
of the spliceosome has been defined. This shows that the spliceosome consists of large and small subunits, with a tunnel or channel in between that
can accommodate the RNA that is about to undergo splicing (Figure 6.14).
The RNA components of the spliceosome are small nuclear RNA molecules ranging from 56 to 217 bases in size which are rich in uridine residues.
They are therefore known as snRNAs or U RNAs. Each of these snRNAs has
a specific role in the splicing process and each of them is associated with
specific proteins forming small nuclear ribonucleoprotein particles
(snRNPs) which consist of a U RNA with its associated proteins. Some of
these proteins such as the Sm proteins are common to all the different
snRNPs, whereas others such as the U1 snRNP A protein are associated with
only one specific RNP particle.
The spliceosome which carries out RNA splicing is assembled in a multistep binding process in which different snRNPs bind to the substrate RNA to
be spliced. This process is initiated by the binding of the U1 snRNP to the 5′
splice site (the junction between the upstream exon and the beginning of
the intron) (Figure 6.15a). Subsequently the U2 accessory factor (U2AF)
binds to the polypyrimidine tract located between the branch point A and

the AG at the end of the intron. This then results in the U2 snRNP binding at
the adjacent branch point (Figure 6.15b). Next, the RNA is bound by the U5
snRNP which binds to the upstream exon and by the single snRNP which
contains the U4 and U6 RNAs bound to one another. This binding results in
the displacement of the U1 snRNP from the 5′ splice site where it is replaced
by the U6 snRNP (Figure 6.15c). This results in the release of the U1 snRNP
and of the U4 RNA, which is now no longer base paired to U6.
The U6 and the U2 snRNPs then interact with one another, bringing the
5′ splice site close to the branch point. This is followed by the separation of
the upstream exon from the intron, lariat formation, and the joining of the
upstream exon to the downstream exon as outlined in Figure 6.13. The U2
snRNP, the U6 snRNP, and the U5 snRNP (which has moved from the
upstream exon to the intron during this process) are released with the intron
(Figure 6.15d).
Interestingly, in the final stage of splicing, an RNA unwinding/helicase
enzyme known as Prp22 binds to the downstream exon (Figure 6.15d). It
then moves along the spliced RNA in a 3′ to 5′ direction, releasing it from the
proteins/RNAs of the spliceosome.
During the splicing process a series of different RNA–protein complexes
with different structures form (Figure 6.16). The initial binding of the Ul
snRNP to the 5′ splice site and of the U2 snRNP to the branch point results
in the formation of complex A (Figure 6.16a). Subsequently, the U4/U6
snRNP and the U5 snRNP bind together in a so-called tri snurp (i.e. with
three different snRNAs) forming complex B (Figure 6.16b). This then triggers a conformational change which releases U1 and U4 to produce the
catalytically active complex Bact (Figure 6.16c). It is in this complex that

the U2 particle to the branch point (b). This
is followed by binding of the U5 particle
to the upstream exon and of the U4/U6
particle to the 5′ splice site with release
of the U1 particle and U4 RNA. U6 and U2
particles then interact with one another (c)
bringing the 5′ splice site adjacent to the
branch point. This is followed by separation
of the upstream exon from the downstream
exon and lariat formation followed by
subsequent separation of the intron from the
downstream exon with exon joining. The free
intron is released in association with the U2,
U5, and U6 particles (d), with the U5 particle
having moved from the upstream exon to a
position within the intron. An RNA helicase
(Prp20) binds to the downstream exon and
moves along the spliced RNA in a 3′ to 5′
direction, releasing it from the spliceosome.

the upstream exon is cleaved away from the intron which forms a lariat
structure with the downstream exon. A further conformational change then
occurs to produce complex C (Figure 6.16d) in which the two exons are
joined together and then released together with the free intron in the lariat
structure (Figure 6.16e).
Several of the interactions between the U snRNPs and the RNA that is
being spliced are mediated by complementary base pairing between the U
RNA in the RNP and the RNA undergoing splicing. For example, the U1
RNA base pairs to the 5′ splice site in the initial phase of splicing, thereby
allowing the UI RNP to bind to the 5′ splice site. Similarly, the later displacement of the U1 RNP by the U4/U6 RNP is mediated by U6 binding to
the 5′ splice site.
Of most interest however, is the binding of the U2 RNP to the RNA
sequence around the branch point. Not only is this mediated by the U2 RNA
but the A at the branch point does not participate in the base pairing. It is
therefore displaced from the double-stranded structure, facilitating the

FIGURe 6.16
Binding of the U1 and U2 particles to the
RNA to be spliced results in the formation of
an RNA–protein complex known as complex
A (a). Subsequently the U4/U6 particle and
the U5 particle bind to form complex B (b).
This then triggers a conformational change
releasing U1 and U4 and resulting in the
formation of the catalytically active complex
Bact (c). Within this complex the upstream
exon is cleaved from the intron which forms
a lariat structure with the downstream exon.
A further conformational change produces
complex c (d) in which the upstream and
downstream exons are joined together and
the intron is released as a free lariat (e).

formation of the bond between its 2′ hydroxyl group and the 5′ end of the
intron (Figure 6.17).
Hence, the entire process of splicing takes place in the tightly ordered
structure of the spliceosome and this explains, for example, why the
upstream exon cannot simply diffuse away after its separation from the
intron/downstream exon. Indeed, it has been demonstrated that a specific
component of the spliceosome, hSLu7, binds tightly to the upstream exon
and holds it in close proximity to the AG of the correct 3′ splice site, so
allowing selection of the correct 3′ splice site to occur.
As indicated above, several different snRNAs bind to the RNA undergoing
splicing, with such binding occurring to either the same region of the target
RNA as for U1 and U6 or to different regions. Such multiple base pairing
events provide the opportunity to continuously monitor the input RNA or
the splicing intermediates within the spliceosome for any errors that could
result in an aberrantly spliced RNA that in turn would produce an abnormal
protein. If such abnormalities are detected, the splicing process is aborted,
the RNA is discarded, and the spliceosome disassembles (Figure 6.18).
In addition to the snRNAs and the proteins associated with them in the
snRNPs, the splicesosome also contains other proteins that are not directly
associated with the snRNAs. The most intensively studied of these are a
series of proteins which are rich in serine and arginine residues and which
are therefore known as SR proteins (S = serine, R = arginine in the oneletter code for amino acids).
These proteins are believed to serve both in recruiting the snRNPs to the
RNA to be spliced and in determining which splice sites are joined to one
another. It appears that the SR proteins bind to sequences within the exons,
known as exon-splicing enhancers (ESEs) and ensure that the exon is
included in the final spliced RNA rather than being spliced out.
As the vast majority of RNAs contain multiple exons and introns (rather
than the simple two-exon, one-intron model we have been considering)
this role of SR proteins is obviously highly critical to ensure that the correct
exons are joined to one another. Thus, the splicing process must ensure that
exon 1 is joined to exon 2 which in turn is joined to exon 3 rather than, for
example, exon 1 being joined to exon 3 resulting in exon 2 being missing
from the mRNA and therefore producing a protein lacking a particular
region. Mutations in ESEs which prevent binding of SR proteins result in the
affected exon being spliced out in a process known as exon skipping
(Figure 6.19) and this occurs in specific human diseases (see Chapter 12,
Sections 12.3 and 12.6 for discussion of human diseases that involve abnormalities in RNA splicing and their potential therapy).

In view of their role in determining which splice sites will be joined to
one another, it is not surprising that the SR proteins also play a key role in
the process known as alternative splicing in which different combinations
of exons can be joined to one another in different situations (see Chapter 7,
Section 7.1 for discussion of alternative RNA splicing and its important role
in the regulation of gene expression).
It was initially thought that all introns in genes transcribed by RNA polymerase II began with the GU sequence and ended with the AG sequence.
Although this is true for the vast majority of introns, a small number begin
with the sequence AU and end with AC (Figure 6.20). These introns are
spliced by a mechanism which is similar to the GU–AG pathway described
above and involves, for example, exactly the same use of an A residue at the
branch point.
However, splicing of AU–AC introns involves only the U5 snRNP of those
used in the GU–AG pathway and instead utilizes different snRNPs, containing, respectively, the U11, U12, U4atac, and U6atac RNAs (Figure 6.20).
Interestingly, it has been suggested that some splicing of AU–AC introns
takes place in the cytoplasm, indicating that this minor splicing pathway
may have a function distinct from that of the major GU–AG pathway, which
is exclusively nuclear.

that this was the case was the finding that deletion of the C-terminal domain

not only reduces transcription but also interferes with post-transcriptional
processes such as capping, splicing, and polyadenylation, indicating that
RNA polymerase II is also involved in these events.
As described in Chapter 4 (Section 4.1), phosphorylation of the CTD of the
RPB1 subunit of RNA polymerase II leads to the polymerase together with
TFIIF, initiating transcription and moving off down the gene, leaving behind
the other basal transcription factors, such as TFIIB and TFIID (Figure 6.21a).
Interestingly, these basal factors are then progressively replaced by factors
that are involved in capping, splicing, and polyadenylation, and which bind
specifically to the phosphorylated form of the RNA polymerase II CTD.
As soon as transcription begins, capping enzymes bind to the CTD of
RNA polymerase II, allowing the 5′ end of the RNA to be capped as described
in Section 6.1 (Figure 6.21b). Subsequently, the SR proteins and other
components of the splicing complex (see Section 6.3) bind to the CTD
allowing splicing to occur (Figure 6.21c), and components of the polyadenylation complex (see Section 6.2) interact with the transcribing complex
and polyadenylate the RNA (Figure 6.21d).
Interestingly, the recruitment of these various factors is closely coupled
to the phosphorylation of the CTD of the RPB1 subunit RNA polymerase II.
As noted in Chapter 4 (Sections 4.1 and 4.2), this region contains multiple
copies of the amino acid sequence Tyr-Ser-Pro-Thr-Ser-Pro-Ser. It has been
shown that phosphorylation of serine 5 in this sequence (which stimulates
transcriptional initiation) is also essential for recruitment of capping factors.
Moreover, subsequent phosphorylation of serine 2 (which stimulates transcriptional elongation) is also necessary for recruitment of factors involved
in 3′ end processing and polyadenylation (Figure 6.22).

The dual role of CTD phosphorylation in transcriptional elongation
and processing of the RNA transcript therefore couples the two events,
ensuring that the elongating RNA transcript is correctly processed. Indeed,
this linkage provides the explanation for the relationship between capping and transcriptional elongation which was discussed in Section 6.1.
Thus, following phosphorylation of the CTD on serine 5 by the kinase
activity of TFIIH, capping of the RNA transcript occurs and this stimulates
phosphorylation of the CTD on serine 2 by pTEF-b, not only allowing the
recruitment of 3′ processing factors but also stimulating transcriptional
elongation itself.
These events therefore ensure that capping of the transcript is closely associated with the onset of transcriptional elongation, ensuring that the nascent
transcript has an appropriately modified 5′ end. Similarly, cleavage and polyadenylation of the transcript are closely linked to the termination of transcription, ensuring the production of an appropriately modified 3′ end of the RNA.
Interestingly, the relationship of transcription and splicing appears to be
more complex. Thus, as noted above, RNA splicing factors such as the SR
proteins can associate with the transcriptional complex and introns are
removed while transcription is still occurring (Figure 6.23a). In such cases
of co-transcriptional splicing, the removal of introns may occur prior to polyadenylation rather than after it.
In addition however, some splicing events also occur after transcription
has terminated. Indeed, such splicing can take place after the capped and
polyadenylated RNA has been released from the DNA (Figure 6.23b).
Clearly these different forms of splicing offer different regulatory possibilities, either closely linking the process of splicing to that of transcription or
potentially rendering the two processes independent.
Moreover, they result in transcriptional elongation and splicing processes being able to interact in multiple ways, both with each other and
with the processes that regulate chromatin structure (see Chapters 2 and 3).
Thus, for example, a more tight packing of the nucleosomes on a particular
gene may slow down transcriptional elongation and allow sufficient time
for co-transcriptional splicing (as in Figure 6.23a). In contrast, when transcriptional elongation proceeds more rapidly, transcription may terminate
before there is time for particular introns to be removed (as in Figure 6.23b).
Another aspect of this linkage between transcriptional elongation,
post-transcriptional processes and chromatin structure involves the effect of
histone modifications (see Chapter 3, Section 3.3). The addition of three
methyl residues to the arginine at position four in histone H3 has been
shown to be associated with a more open chromatin structure. Interestingly
however, trimethylation of this arginine residue has also been shown to
enhance the recruitment of the FACT protein which is involved in transcriptional elongation (see Chapter 4, Section 4.2) and of the U2 snRNP involved
in RNA splicing (see Section 6.3). In this case therefore, enhanced transcriptional elongation is associated with enhanced splicing of the resulting transcript (Figure 6.24).

Post-transcriptional processes can interact with one another

FIGURe 6.25
Both the cap-binding complex (cBc) and
the cPSF (cleavage and polyadenylation
specificity factor) polyadenylation complex
can interact with the spliceosome (S),
so linking together these different posttranscriptional events.

As well as interactions between factors involved in post-transcriptional processes and the transcriptional complex, there is also evidence that the factors
involved in different post-transcriptional processes interact with one another.
For example, the cap-binding complex (see Section 6.1) can interact with the
spliceosome (Section 6.3) linking the processes of capping and splicing.
Similarly, the U2 snRNP (Section 6.3) has been shown to interact with the
CPSF polyadenylation factor (Section 6.2), thereby coupling splicing with
polyadenylation. These interactions will obviously ensure that all the modifications of the RNA transcript that we have discussed can be closely linked
with one another and with the process of transcription itself (Figure 6.25).
Therefore, as it moves down the gene the transcription complex attracts
the factors that are needed to post-transcriptionally modify the RNA and in
many cases this occurs while the RNA is being transcribed, paralleling the
translation of the RNA while it is being transcribed that occurs in prokaryotes. Once the processes of transcription, capping, splicing, and polyadenylation have taken place, the RNA is fully mature and ready to be transported
to the cytoplasm.

6.5

RNA TRANSPORT

RNA transport is coupled to other post-transcriptional processes
Although the processes of capping, polyadenylation, and RNA splicing take
place in the nucleus, the process of translation whereby the mature mRNA
is converted into protein takes place in the cytoplasm. The processed RNA
must therefore be transported through the nuclear membrane from the
nucleus to the cytoplasm before it can be translated into protein.
A number of proteins which associate with the RNA in the nucleus and
accompany it into the cytoplasm have been identified and are believed to
play a critical role in mediating the transport of the RNA from the nucleus to
the cytoplasm which occurs via pores in the nuclear membrane. In the
insect Chironomus tentans this process can be directly visualized in the electron microscope, with a ribonucleoprotein particle consisting of multiple
proteins associated with mRNA being observed passing through the nuclear
pore into the cytoplasm (Figure 6.26).
As described in Chapter 4 (Section 4.1), genes are transcribed in specific
regions of the nucleus which are frequently located adjacent to nuclear
pores, so facilitating the ultimate transport of the RNA to the cytoplasm
once it is fully processed. The actual transport of the fully processed mRNA
through the nuclear pore involves it becoming associated with the RNA
exporter complex (REC), which consists of two proteins, Mex67 and Mtr2

(also known as NXF1 and NXT1, respectively). Most interestingly, the REC is
recruited to the mRNA via factors that have already bound to it and are
involved in the various post-transcriptional processes that we have already
discussed, namely 5′ capping, RNA splicing, and polyadenylation.
For example, REC can associate with the SR proteins, which as described
in Section 6.3, bind to exon splicing enhancers and are involved in RNA
splicing. This association of REC and SR proteins is regulated by phosphorylation of the SR proteins. SR proteins initially bind to the RNA in a phosphorylated form which cannot recruit REC. Following splicing of the mRNA
however, SR proteins are dephosphorylated and therefore can bind REC,
allowing transport to the cytoplasm to occur. This system effectively couples
transport of the mRNA to its splicing, ensuring that intron-containing RNAs
are not transported (Figure 6.27).
This linkage between splicing and transport is supplemented in higher
eukaryotes by a linkage between capping (Section 6.1) and mRNA transport.
A complex of proteins known as TREX is recruited to the mRNA by binding
to the cap-binding complex located at the 5′ end of the mRNA. This results
in TREX being located at the 5′ end of the mRNA and it then recruits the REC
complex. In turn, this leads to the 5′ end of the RNA passing through the
nuclear pore first (Figure 6.28), so allowing the rapid initiation of mRNA
translation into protein.

As well as being recruited via 5′ cap-binding factors and splicing factors, the REC complex can also be recruited via factors bound near the
3′ end of the RNA which are involved in its polyadenylation. Thus, the
Swd2 component of the CPSF polyadenylation complex (see Section 6.2)
can recruit the Mex67 component of REC, thereby recruiting the REC to
the 3′ end of the RNA.
Interestingly, recruitment of Mex67 is greatly enhanced when Swd2 is
modified by ubiquitination. In turn, such ubiquitination is stimulated by the
ubiquitination of histone H2B (see Chapter 3, Section 3.3). This therefore
provides a further link between transcriptional and post-transcriptional processes, with the modification of a chromatin-bound histone stimulating the
similar modification of a polyadenylation factor, which in turn stimulates
the recruitment of a key RNA export factor (Figure 6.29).
Hence, factors involved in 5′ capping, RNA splicing, and 3′ polyadenylation can all stimulate the recruitment of the REC (Figure 6.30). The proper
coordination of these processes ensures that only appropriately modified
and spliced RNA is transported to the cytoplasm where it can be translated
into protein.

The process of translating the mRNA into protein takes place on defined
cytoplasmic organelles known as ribosomes, which in eukaryotes consist of
a large subunit of 60S in size and a small subunit of 40S in size. Each of
these subunits contains both specific RNAs and proteins. The large subunit
consists of 28S, 5.8S, and 5S ribosomal RNAs associated with 49 different
proteins, while the small subunit consists of an 18S ribosomal RNA and 33
associated proteins (Figure 6.31).
Although prokaryotic ribosomes are slightly smaller (70S in size), they
also have two subunits (50S and 30S) each with their own specific larger

Structural studies of prokaryotic ribosomes, using X-ray crystallography
have provided a detailed understanding of the way in which the various
RNAs and proteins are arranged within the two subunits and how these
subunits associate with one another (Figure 6.32).
More recently, detailed structural analysis has been carried out on eukaryotic ribosomes obtained from the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae
(Figure 6.33) and the protozoan Tetrahymena thermophilia. This has
revealed a fundamentally similar structure to that of prokaryotic ribosomes,
with a number of highly conserved proteins located especially at the core of
both ribosomal subunits. Interestingly however, a number of eukaryoticspecific ribosomal proteins are located on the exposed surface of both
subunits associated with expanded regions of the ribosomal RNAs in an
RNA–protein layer (Figure 6.34). In this position, these proteins can facilitate interaction between the two ribosomal subunits and between the ribosome and other factors.
This process is taken further in the recently determined structures of the
ribosome in higher eukaryotes such as the fruit fly Drosophila and humans
where the RNA–protein layer is not only larger but is surrounded by two
additional layers of RNA (Figure 6.34).

Translational initiation involves initiation factors binding
to the cap
In eukaryotes, translation is initiated by the binding of the eukaryotic
­initiation factor (eIF), eIF4E, to the cap structure at the 5′ end of the
mRNA, replacing the cap-binding complex (Section 6.1) (Figure 6.35a).
Subsequently, other eIF factors, such as eIF4G and eIF4A/B, bind to the
5′ end of the RNA (Figure 6.35b). Together, eIF4A, eIF4E, and eIF4G form
a complex which is known as eIF4F. The binding of the various components
of eIF4F is followed by the binding of a complex consisting of the small 40S
ribosomal subunit, a transfer RNA molecule (tRNA) which carries the amino
acid methionine, and the initiation factor eIF2 (Figure 6.35c).
Subsequently as described in Section 6.1, the 40S subunit migrates
down the mRNA until it finds an AUG initiation sequence in the mRNA
which is located in the appropriate context for the initiation of translation
(Figure 6.35d). At this point, eIF2 is released from the complex and the
60S large ribosomal subunit binds to the small subunit. This forms the
complete 80S ribosome which is able to initiate translation (Figure 6.35e).
Several other factors including eIF5, eIF5b, and eIF6 play an essential role
in the joining of the large and small ribosomal subunits.

Translation involves base pairing of triplet codons in the mRNA
with tRNA anticodons
A key role in the process of translation is played by the transfer RNA (tRNA)
molecules. These RNAs are unique in that they can bind an amino acid
at their 3′ end (Figure 6.36). They therefore function to bring the amino
acids to the ribosome for incorporation into protein. The tRNAs are RNA

molecules from 74 to 95 bases in length which can fold into a highly defined
secondary structure (Figure 6.36). In this structure, one specific loop contains
the so-called anticodon. Each tRNA molecule that binds a different amino
acid has a distinct anticodon of three bases that can pair with the complementary three-base codon within the mRNA. For example, the initiator
tRNA described above contains the anticodon sequence CAU and therefore
binds to the initiator AUG codon. This initiator tRNA carries a methionine
amino acid linked to it and the chain of the protein molecule thus normally
begins with a methionine residue (Figure 6.37a).
Although translational initiation most frequently involves pairing of an
AUG codon with the CAU anticodon in the initiator tRNA carrying methionine (Figure 6.38a), in some genes initiation can occur at codons with one
change from AUG such as CUG or GUG, presumably because these sequences
are located within appropriate flanking sequences that fit Kozak’s rules (see
Section 6.1). In many such cases, these codons are recognized by the same
initiator tRNA carrying methionine, with a one-base mismatch occurring
between the codon and the anticodon, resulting in the protein beginning
with methionine as before (Figure 6.38b). In other cases however, a CUG
initiation codon is recognized by a tRNA with a perfectly matching CAG
anticodon (Figure 6.38c). Since this tRNA carries a leucine amino acid
rather than a methionine, this results in the polypeptide chain beginning
with a leucine rather than a methionine.

Clearly, the existence of such different initiation codons allows the
possibility of translation of different genes being differently regulated in different circumstances, particularly since translational initiation with a
leucine-bearing tRNA does not require eIF2 and can therefore take place
when this factor is absent or inactivated (see Chapter 7, Section 7.6 for discussion of the regulation of translation).

FIGURe 6.37
Translation elongation. Following the arrival
of the ribosome at the initiator AUG codon
and binding of the initiator tRNA bearing a
methionine amino acid to the AUG codon
in the P site of the ribosome (a, see also
Figure 6.32), a second tRNA is recruited
in association with the elongation factor
eeF1 and binds to the next codon in the
A site of the ribosome via its corresponding
anticodon (b). Note that this codon may have
any sequence depending on the next amino
acid to be incorporated into the protein, a
cUG codon which recruits tRNA with the
anticodon sequence cAG and bearing a
leucine amino acid is shown as an example.
Subsequently, a peptide bond is formed
between the methionine and the next amino
acid (leucine in this case), with translocation
of the methionine to bond with the leucine
residue. The elongation factor eeF1 then
initiates translocation of the ribosome three
bases along the mRNA and the first tRNA
moves to the e site of the ribosome and is
released (c). The cycle then repeats itself
with a new tRNA being recruited to the next
three bases (d), with consequent peptide
bond formation producing a three-amino
acid peptide.

Translational elongation involves tRNAs located in two distinct
sites within the ribosome
Following initiation of translation, a further tRNA molecule bearing the
appropriate anticodon is recruited to bind to the next three-base sequence
in the mRNA immediately downstream of the initiating AUG sequence. This
binding site for tRNA is known as the A (amino acid) site of the ribosome
whereas at this stage the initiator tRNA occupies the adjacent P (peptide)
site of the ribosome. As each particular tRNA containing a specific anticodon also binds to a specific amino acid, this tRNA will deliver a particular
amino acid to the mRNA-bound ribosome, with the nature of the amino
acid being specified by the nature of the three-base codon immediately following the AUG (Figure 6.37b).
This second tRNA is recruited to the ribosome by a specific eukaryotic
elongation factor (eEF) eEF1. The structure of the ribosome allows two
specific sites (the A and P sites) within it to be occupied by tRNA molecules
which are bound to adjacent three-base sequences in the mRNA. Once this
has occurred, an enzymatic activity associated with the large ribosomal
subunit forms a peptide bond between the two amino acids which are
bound to the two adjacent tRNA molecules. In this manner, the growth of
the peptide chain of the protein molecule begins.
Subsequently, another elongation factor, eEF2, catalyzes the move of the
ribosome three more bases down the mRNA molecule (Figure 6.37c). This
moves the tRNA carrying the nascent peptide chain to the P site. At the
same time, the initiator tRNA moves into the E (exit site) on the ribosome
and it is then released from the mRNA. The ribosome structure illustrated in
Figure 6.32 shows tRNAs occupying the P and E sites.
These movements allow a further tRNA molecule to be recruited to the
ribosome-bound mRNA by eEF1 and occupy the now vacant A site (Figure
6.37d). This tRNA contains an anticodon which can bind to the next threebase codon in the mRNA sequence and has a specific amino acid bound to
it. Once again, a peptide bond is formed between the two-amino acid chain
and this third amino acid, with the resulting three-amino acid peptide being
transferred to the new tRNA.
In this manner, the amino acid chain of the protein is gradually built up
(Figure 6.37). As each tRNA with a particular anticodon binds a specific
amino acid, amino acids are added to the chain in accordance with the

FIGURe 6.38
Translation normally initiates at an AUG
codon with the three-base codon in the
mRNA base pairing with the cAU anticodon
in the initiator tRNA linked to a methionine
(Met) amino acid (a). In some cases the
initiator tRNA carrying methionine can be
recruited via pairing of only two bases in
the anticodon with an AUG-related codon
such as cUG or GUG (b). In other cases
however, the presence of a cUG codon in
the mRNA recruits a tRNA with a matching
cAG anticodon which carries a leucine
(leu) amino acid, leading to initiation of the
polypeptide chain with leucine rather than
methionine (c).

anticodon of the tRNA which is recruited. In turn this is determined by the
codon present in the mRNA and so the information in the mRNA is gradually
translated into protein in accordance with the genetic code (Table 6.1).
As can be seen from Table 6.1, many amino acids are encoded by multiple codons. In some cases, this is because the amino acid concerned can
bind two or more tRNAs which have different anticodons and therefore bind
to different codons in the mRNA. Interestingly, the use of one or other of
these multiple codons to specify a particular amino acid within a specific
mRNA may affect the translation of the mRNA containing it. Thus, different
tRNAs are present at different levels in the cell. The use of a codon which
corresponds to a more abundant tRNA may result in the mRNA containing
it being translated at higher level or more rapidly than would have occurred
if the mRNA contained a different codon which binds a less abundant tRNA
bearing the same amino acid.
In addition to the use of multiple tRNAs, in some cases the same tRNA
can bind to different codons in the mRNA, so allowing these different
codons to direct the insertion of the same amino acid. This so-called
‘wobble
effect’ normally involves unusual pairing between the third
­
base of the codon in the mRNA and the first base of the anticodon in the
tRNA. Because of the unusual structure of the tRNA at this point, a U residue in the wobble position of the codon can form either a normal base
pair with an A residue or an unusual base pair with a G residue in the
tRNA (Figure 6.39a and b). Similarly, inosine, which is a modified purine
base that is found in tRNA, can pair with U or C residues in the wobble
position of the mRNA (Figure 6.39c and d).

Translational termination occurs at specific stop codons
Ultimately, the moving ribosome encounters one of the three stop codons
(UAA, UAG, or UGA) which are not recognized by a specific tRNA and a
release factor (eRF1) catalyzes the release of the completed polypeptide

Binding of the codon in the mRNA to the
anticodon in the tRNA can involve a normal

the first position of the anticodon (a) or an
unusual U–G base pair (b). Similarly, an I

anticodon can pair with either a U residue (c)
or a c residue (d) at the third position of the

from the ribosome. Interestingly, although it is a protein, this release factor
resembles a tRNA molecule in its shape. It can therefore bind to the A site
in the ribosome when this site contains a stop codon. As there is now no
amino acid in the A site, a water molecule is added to the end of the peptide
chain which is bound at the P site. This results in its release from the ribosome and the termination of translation (Figure 6.40).
Interestingly, binding of release factors to the ribosome can also occur
even in the absence of a stop codon in the A site. This is observed when the
wrong tRNA is bound in error by the mRNA resulting in a codon–anticodon
mismatch in the A site. This would evidently result in the insertion of an
incorrect amino acid into the protein. Binding of release factors under these

conditions therefore provides a proofreading mechanism, prematurely
terminating the translation of a protein which would contain an incorrect
amino acid.
Although we have described the movement of a single ribosome down
the mRNA, multiple ribosomes will be moving along the mRNA at the same
time, forming a structure known as a polyribosome. Interestingly, the
poly(A) tail-binding protein, which is bound to the poly(A) tail at the 3′ end
of the mRNA, can interact with the eIF4G component of the translation initiation complex located at the 5′ end of the mRNA. This means that the
polyribosome-bearing mRNA can assume a circular configuration. In turn,
this allows ribosomes which complete translation and terminate at the 3′
end of the mRNA to reinitiate a new round of translation at the 5′ end of the
mRNA (Figure 6.41).
The production of the final protein molecule completes the process
which began with the transcription of the gene and results in the genetic
information encoded in the DNA, and subsequently in the RNA being converted into a functional protein molecule.

RNA DeGRADATION

RNA degradation occurs in both the nucleus and the cytoplasm
As discussed in previous sections, mechanisms exist to tightly couple transcription and the various post-transcriptional processes so that a correctly
processed mRNA is transported to the cytoplasm. RNA molecules that fail at
any stage in this process, for example, by being incorrectly spliced, will be
degraded in the nucleus. This process is carried out by a multiprotein complex known as the exosome, which contains a 3′ to 5′ exonuclease that
digests the incorrectly spliced RNA beginning at its 3′ end. Such intranuclear
degradation is also the fate of introns, which are removed from the transcript in the normal process of splicing (Figure 6.42).
FIGURe 6.42
Both introns removed from the mRNA in the normal process of splicing
and incorrectly spliced RNAs are degraded in the nucleus. Following
transport of correctly spliced RNAs to the cytoplasm, functional transcripts
are translated into protein and subsequently degraded. Nonfunctional
transcripts with premature stop codons (circle) are rapidly degraded in a
process known as nonsense-mediated decay.

However, even where an mRNA is successfully transported to the cytoplasm, its ultimate fate is to be broken down and degraded. In the case of
functional mRNAs, this occurs after the mRNA has been translated one or
more times by the ribosome to produce functional protein. However, a second RNA degradation mechanism also exists in the cytoplasm which is
known as nonsense-mediated RNA decay. This recognizes and degrades
mRNAs that are nonfunctional because they have a premature stop codon,
which would prevent them being translated to produce a functional protein.
These two processes will be discussed in turn (Figure 6.42).

RNA degradation in the cytoplasm involves prior deadenylation
and decapping of the mRNA
As noted in previous sections, functional mRNAs which are transported to
the cytoplasm will have a 5′ cap and 3′ poly(A) tail. The predominant process for degrading these mRNAs begins with the removal of the poly(A) tail
in a process known as deadenylation. This process renders the mRNA subject to attack by the 3′ to 5′ exonuclease of the exosome complex (see above)
which degrades it from its 3′ end. The exosome complex therefore plays a
key role both in the degradation of nonfunctional RNAs in the nucleus and
in the turnover of functional mRNAs in the cytoplasm.
Moreover, the removal of the poly(A) tail leads to deadenylationdependent decapping of the RNA. This removes the 5′ cap of the mRNA and
not only prevents its further translation but also renders it susceptible
to degradation by 5′ to 3′ exonucleases, which degrade the mRNA from its 5′
end (Figure 6.43).
Interestingly, this degradation of the mRNA can occur in small granular
structures within the cytoplasm, known as P-bodies. These P-bodies contain the proteins involved in decapping the mRNA, such as the DCP1 activator of decapping and the DCP2 enzyme which catalyzes the actual
decapping process (Figure 6.44).

Abnormal mRNAs are degraded in the cytoplasm by a
nonsense-mediated RNA decay process
As well as providing a site for the degradation of functional mRNAs that
have been translated one or more times and have completed their useful
life, P-bodies are also involved in the process of nonsense-mediated RNA
decay. This process involves the same decapping and deadenylation
enzymes involved in the degradation of functional mRNAs. It also involves
the exosome complex, which as described above, also catalyzes the degradation of aberrant RNAs in the nucleus as well as the cytoplasmic turnover
of functional mRNAs. In this case however, it targets nonfunctional mRNAs
which have entered the cytoplasm but which contain a premature stop
codon that would produce an aberrant truncated protein.

Clearly, the critical question is how the cell recognizes these abnormal
mRNAs in the cytoplasm and directs them to the RNA degradation pathway. This is achieved by recognizing that the stop codon is located at an
incorrect place in the mRNA. In functional mRNAs, the stop codon for
translation is usually located in the last exon of the transcript. This means
that it will be located downstream of a protein complex, known as the
exon junction complex (EJC). This complex binds to each exon during
splicing at a position 20–24 bases upstream of the junction between two
exons and remains associated with it during transport to the cytoplasm. A
normally located stop codon would be located downstream of the last EJC,
whereas an abnormally located codon would be found upstream of it
(Figure 6.45).
Following the transport of an mRNA to the cytoplasm, an initial round of
translation takes place during which the ribosome normally displaces successive EJCs and then reaches the correctly located stop codon where it
terminates translation. Once this process has been completed, further
rounds of translation of the fully functional mRNA will take place (Figure
6.46a). In contrast, on an RNA with an incorrectly located stop codon, the

ribosome will terminate translation prematurely leaving an EJC still bound
to the aberrant mRNA. This is thought to result in the recruitment of the
surveillance complex (SURF) which in turn recruits the enzymes involved in
deadenylation, decapping, and RNA degradation (Figure 6.46b).

CONCLUSIONS
This chapter has described the processes which modify the RNA transcript
at its 5′ and 3′ ends, remove its intervening sequences, transport it to the
cytoplasm, and eventually translate it into protein. Clearly, since all these
events are necessary for protein production, they represent targets for
gene regulatory processes. Similarly, the process of RNA degradation will
not only ensure that nonfunctional mRNAs are rapidly degraded but will
also control the amount of protein produced from a functional mRNA
before it is degraded. The regulation of gene expression at these various
post-transcriptional stages is discussed in the next chapter.

KeY CONCePTS
•

The process of transcription of the DNA into RNA is complemented
by a number of post-transcriptional events which produce a
functional mRNA able to be transported to the cytoplasm and
translated into protein.

•

Shortly after transcription is initiated, the nascent RNA transcript
is modified by addition of a cap to its 5′ end.

•

The RNA transcript is cleaved at its 3′ end and a run of A residues
is added in a process known as polyadenylation.

•

Intervening sequences or introns are removed from the RNA by the
process of RNA splicing.

•

The processes of transcription, capping, splicing, and
polyadenylation are tightly coupled within the nucleus.

•

The fully spliced and correctly modified mRNA is recognized by
export proteins which transport the mRNA to the cytoplasm.

•

The mRNA is translated into protein in the cytoplasm by the
ribosome.

•

The process of nonsense-mediated decay rapidly degrades
nonfunctional mRNA in the cytoplasm.

•

After one or more rounds of translation by the ribosome,
functional mRNAs are deadenylated and decapped, which exposes
them to degradation by nucleases.

Post-transcriptional Regulation

INTRODUCTION
The evidence discussed in Chapter 1 (Section 1.4), indicates that in mammals at least the primary control of gene expression lies at the level of transcription. However, a number of cases exist where changes in the rate of
synthesis of a particular protein occur without a change in the transcription
rate of the corresponding gene or where post-transcriptional controls operate as a significant supplement to transcriptional control. This indicates that
in these cases regulatory processes are operating at the level of one or more
of the post-transcriptional events described in Chapter 6. Indeed, in some
lower organisms post-transcriptional regulation may constitute the predominant form of regulation of gene expression.
In the sea urchin, for example, the nuclear RNA contains many more
different RNA species than are found in the cytoplasmic messenger RNA. A
large proportion of the transcribed genes give rise to RNA products that are
not transported to the cytoplasm and do not function as a messenger RNA.
Interestingly, however, this process is regulated differently in different tissues; an RNA species which is confined to the nucleus (where it will ultimately be degraded) in one tissue, being transported to the cytoplasm and
functioning as a messenger RNA in another tissue. Indeed, up to 80% of the
cytoplasmic mRNAs found in the embryonic blastula are absent from
the cytoplasmic RNA of adult tissues such as the intestine but are found in
the nuclear RNA of such tissues.
Although such post-transcriptional regulation in mammals does not
appear to be as generalized as in the sea urchin, some cases exist where
changes in cytoplasmic mRNA levels occur without alterations in the rate of
gene transcription. Post-transcriptional regulation of this type may be more
important in controlling variations in the level of mRNA species expressed
in all tissues than in the regulation of mRNA species that are expressed in
only one or a few tissues. For example, in the experiments of Darnell and
colleagues, which demonstrated the importance of transcriptional control
in the regulation of liver-specific mRNAs (see Chapter 1, Section 1.4),
tissue-specific differences in the levels of the mRNAs encoding actin and
tubulin (which are expressed in all cell types) were observed in the absence
of differences in transcription rates. Clearly, these and other cases where
mRNA levels alter in the absence of changes in transcription rates indicate
the existence of post-transcriptional control processes and require an
understanding of their mechanisms.
In principle, such post-transcriptional regulation could operate at any of
the many stages between gene transcription and the translation of the corresponding mRNA in the cytoplasm which were described in Chapter 6.
Indeed, the available evidence indicates that in different cases regulation can
occur at any one of these levels. Each of these will now be discussed in turn.

Chapter 7: Post-transcriptional Regulation

7.1 ALTERNATIVE RNA SPLICING

Tissue 1

RNA splicing can be regulated
The finding that the protein-coding regions of eukaryotic genes are split by
intervening sequences (introns), which must be removed from the initial
transcript by RNA splicing of the protein-coding exons (see Chapter 6,
Section 6.3), led to much speculation that this process might provide a
major site of gene regulation. In theory, an RNA species transcribed in several tissues might be correctly spliced to yield functional RNA in one tissue
and remain unspliced in another tissue. An unspliced RNA would either be
degraded within the nucleus or if transported to the cytoplasm, would
be unable to produce a functional protein due to the interruption of the
protein-coding regions (Figure 7.1).
Several cases of such processing versus discard decisions have now
been described in Drosophila and a similar pathway in which unspliced
RNAs are specifically degraded within the nucleus has been characterized in
yeast. Hence, in lower organisms, there appear to be regulatory pathways in
which a particular transcript is spliced to produce a functional mRNA in one
situation while remaining unspliced and then being degraded within the
nucleus in another situation.

Alternative splicing represents a major regulatory process
which supplements transcriptional control
Although processing versus discard decisions of the type described above
are not widespread in mammals, numerous cases of alternative RNA
splicing have been described in both mammals and other organisms. In
this process, a single gene is transcribed in several different tissues, the
transcripts from this gene being processed differentially to yield different
functional messenger RNAs in the different tissues (Figure 7.2). In many
cases, these RNAs are translated to yield different protein products.
It is noteworthy that this mechanism of gene regulation involves not
only regulation of processing but also regulation of transcription. Thus, the
primary transcript of an alternatively spliced gene is frequently transcribed
in only a restricted range of cell types and not in many other cells. The cells
that express the primary transcript then splice it in different ways to produce
different mRNAs.
Cases of alternative RNA processing occur in the genes involved in a
wide variety of different cellular processes, ranging from genes which regulate embryonic development or sex determination in Drosophila to those
involved in muscular contraction or neuronal function in mammals. Indeed,
recent studies of the whole human genome concluded that over 90% of
human genes with multiple exons are alternatively spliced.
In many cases, such alternative splicing can produce many different
mRNAs from a single primary RNA transcript. For example, the primary RNA
transcript encoding the skeletal muscle troponin T gene can be spliced in up
to 64 different ways in different muscle cell types (Figure 7.3). It should be
noted however, that the production of 64 possible mRNAs is certainly not
the most dramatic example of multiple mRNAs being produced by alternative splicing. For example, the vast number of different alternative exons
found in the Dscam gene of Drosophila could result in over 19,000 different
mRNAs being produced, which is greater than the number of different genes

Alternative RNA splicing involves specific splicing factors that
promote or inhibit the use of specific splice sites
In the case of the troponin T gene discussed above, the artificial introduction
and expression of this gene in non-muscle cells or myoblasts which do not
normally express the gene results in the complete removal of exons 4–8. In
contrast, in muscle cells (myotubes) the correct pattern of alternative splicing seen with the endogenous gene is reproduced faithfully. This indicates
that alternative splicing is regulated by tissue-specific splicing factors which
are expressed only in certain cell types. In the case of the troponin T gene,
such factors would be active only in muscle cells, where they would produce the correct pattern of alternative splicing in different muscle cell types.
The idea that certain factors are necessary for each particular pattern of
splicing in genes such as troponin, begs the question of how such factors
act. It is likely that these factors recognize cis-acting sequences within the
RNA transcript itself. Clearly, the interaction of these factors with such
sequences could produce alternative splicing either by promoting splicing
at the site of the cis-acting sequence at the expense of the alternative splice
site (Figure 7.4a) or by inhibiting splicing at the site of binding and thereby
promoting the use of the alternative splice site (Figure 7.4b).
Both of these types of mechanism appear to be used in different cases.
Indeed examples of each of these mechanisms can be seen in the hierarchy
of alternatively spliced genes which regulates sex determination in
Drosophila. In this hierarchy, each gene product controls the alternative
splicing of the next gene in the pathway, resulting in different protein products in males and females. In turn, these products differentially regulate the
splicing of the next gene in the hierarchy, leading ultimately to the production of a male or female fly (Figure 7.5).
For example, the Sxl gene is differentially spliced in males and females,
with the product of the female-specific mRNA not only controlling the splicing of the next gene in the hierarchy tra, but also promoting its own
female-specific splicing. Mutations which affect this autocatalytic function
of Sxl on its own RNA map in the intron between exon 2 and the malespecific exon 3, indicating that the Sxl protein acts by inhibiting the
male-specific splicing of exons 2 and 3. Similarly Sxl prevents the use of the
male-specific exon 2 in the tra gene by binding within intron 1 and preventing the binding of the constitutive splicing factor U2AF. As U2AF normally
recruits the U2 snRNP particle which is essential for removal of all introns
(see Chapter 6, Section 6.3), this prevents the male-specific splicing event.
In contrast, the action of the tra and tra-2 gene products on the splicing
of the dsx transcript appears to be mediated by promoting the use of the
female-specific splice event rather than the constitutive male-specific

splicing event. In this case, mutations in dsx which affect its splicing map in
the intron between exon 3 and the female-specific exon 4, indicating that
the alternative splicing factor promotes the splicing of exons 3 and 4 (see
below). Splicing factors can therefore act either negatively like Sxl to inhibit
the use of a particular splice site, or positively like Tra to promote the use of
a particular splice site (Figure 7.4).
As well as responding to the presence or absence of a specific factor,
specific RNA sequences can also regulate the pattern of alternative splicing in response to cellular signaling pathways. For example, when the
calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase type IV (CaMKIV signaling) is activated by calcium stimulation, inclusion of a specific exon
(STREX) in transcripts from several neuronally expressed genes such as
the BK potassium channel gene is repressed and the exon is spliced out. In
contrast, in the absence of active CaMKIV, this exon is included in the RNA
(Figure 7.6a). In the case of the BK gene, this effect is mediated by a 54

is inhibited. (b) The response to caMKiV is
mediated by a 54-base pair sequence from
the 3′ splice site upstream of sTReX, which is
known as caMKiV-responsive RNA element
(caRRe). inactivation of this sequence

base pair sequence from the 3′ splice site upstream of the regulated STREX
exon. Mutation of this sequence abolishes regulation of splicing by
CaMKIV, while transferring the sequence to a constitutionally spliced exon
renders it sensitive to CaMKIV regulation (Figure 7.6b). This sequence
thus acts as a CaMKIV-responsive RNA element (CaRRE) regulating splicing of the STREX exon in response to CaMKIV activation.
Interestingly, another CaRRE sequence is found in exon 19 of the gene
encoding the Fox1 RNA-binding protein. Following calcium stimulation, this
exon is therefore excluded from the RNA, producing a Fox1 protein lacking
the corresponding region of the protein. In turn, this results in a Fox1 protein
which can localize to the nucleus. Once it enters the nucleus, the Fox1 protein antagonizes the activity of the CaRRE, resulting in exons such as the
STREX exon now being included in the spliced RNA. This system therefore
produces a self-regulating negative feedback loop in which calcium treatment produces a transient exclusion of CaRRE-containing exons from the
spliced RNAs, which is time-limited due to the production of functional Fox1
(Figure 7.7). The regulation of alternative splicing by specific cellular signaling pathways is discussed further in Chapter 8 (Section 8.6).

an active Fox1 protein which antagonizes the
action of caMKiV and promotes inclusion of
the regulated exons.

The evidence for the existence of alternative splicing factors and the identification of cis-acting sequences with which they interact have led to many
attempts to identify these factors.
In Drosophila, which is genetically very well characterized, the main
approach to this problem has been a genetic one. As discussed above, genes
such as Sxl and tra were originally identified by the fact that mutations within
them disrupted the process of sex determination but are now known to act
by controlling alternative splicing. The products of these genes are alternative splicing factors and their study allows a unique insight into the nature
of such factors.
The sequencing of the Sxl and tra-2 genes has revealed that the proteins
they encode contain one or more copies of a ribonucleoprotein (RNP)
consensus sequence that is found in a wide variety of RNA-binding proteins,
such as those of the mammalian spliceosome, and which constitutes an
RNA-binding domain. Indeed, structural analysis of Sxl bound to the tra
mRNA has shown that the RNA binds to a V-shaped cleft within the Sxl protein (Figure 7.8). Sxl and Tra-2 therefore influence alternative splicing by
binding directly to cis-acting sequences in the alternatively spliced RNAs discussed above.
Hence, specific factors have been identified in Drosophila which are
expressed only in a particular situation and which regulate specific alternative

Chapter 7: Post-transcriptional Regulation

splicing events. Similar cell type-specific factors regulating alternative splicing
have also been identified in vertebrates. For example, in mammals, neuronal
cells specifically express splicing factors such as nPTB, Nova 1, and Nova 2
which play a key role in producing neuronal-specific alternative splicing
events (see Chapter 10, Section 10.2 for further discussion of these factors).
Following the initial identification of an alternative splicing factor it is
possible to use a whole genome method known as cross-linking and
immunoprecipitation (CLIP) to characterize all the RNA molecules to
which the factor binds. As with the chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP)
method described in Chapter 4 (Section 4.3), this method involves immunoprecipitation using antibodies to the factor being studied. However, whereas
the ChIP method characterizes transcription factors bound to DNA, the CLIP
method is used to characterize proteins, such as alternative splicing factors,
which bind to RNA (see Methods Box 7.1, Figure 7.9).
As the method involves using immunoprecipitation to purify the RNA
sequences to which a particular protein has bound, it can be used to
characterize the RNA molecules which are targeted by any RNA-binding
protein for which a specific antibody is available. It is therefore applicable
to both alternative splicing factors and RNA-binding proteins which target
other post-transcriptional processes. Moreover, when combined with highthroughput sequencing techniques, it can be used to identify all the RNA
sequences bound by a specific protein in intact cells and under different
conditions.
Although a number of tissue-specific splicing factors have been characterized by methods of this type, it is clear that constitutively expressed splicing factors may also be involved in the regulation of alternative splicing.
One mechanism by which this can occur is via the post-translational modification of such factors. Thus, for example, the arginine methyltransferase
enzyme CARM1 can modulate splicing by methylating splicing factors such
as the U1C protein, (which is part of the U1 snRNP) and the SmB protein
(which is an Sm protein found in several snRNPs) (see Chapter 6, Section
6.3, for discussion of snRNPs and their composition). This methylation of
splicing proteins promotes the omission of certain exons in target RNAs that
would otherwise be included in the mRNA, thereby promoting specific alternative splicing events.
In addition to post-translational modification, other tissue-specific splicing events depend on quantitative variations in the amount of constitutively
expressed splicing factors that are present in a particular cell type. For
example, the SF2 factor is a member of the SR protein family discussed in
Chapter 6 (Section 6.3), which is present in all cells and is essential for the
basic process of splicing itself. However, its concentration has been shown
to influence which of two competing upstream splice sites is joined to a
downstream site. High concentrations of SF2 favor the more proximal of the
two sites, while low concentrations favor the more distal site (Figure 7.10).
Interestingly the constitutively expressed hnRNPA1 protein binds to RNA
before it is spliced and has the opposite effect, favoring the use of the more
distal site. In this situation, the outcome of a specific alternative splicing

Such a system in which the different outcome of alternative splicing

snRNP particles that are essential for splicing to occur (see Chapter 6,
Section 6.3). Thus, SR proteins can bind to the 5′ splice site and promote the
binding of the Ul snRNP to this site (Figure 7.11a). In addition, as noted in
Chapter 6 (Section 6.3), they can also bind to exon-splicing enhancers
(ESEs) within the exon downstream of the regulated splice site and stimulate the binding of the U2AF protein to the branch point, thereby recruiting
the U2 snRNP particle (Figure 7.11b).
Both tissue-specific factors and variations in constitutively expressed
factors can therefore regulate alternative splicing. Indeed as described
above, both Sxl and SR proteins such as SF2 can act by regulating the
recruitment of U2AF. It is not surprising therefore that some cases of alternative splicing are regulated by the interaction of SR proteins with specifically expressed factors. For example, in the case of the dsx gene, the splicing
of exon 3 to the female-specific exon 4 does not occur in the absence of the
female-specific proteins tra and tra-2 (Figure 7.12). This is because U2AF
binds only weakly to the branch point of this intron and the binding site of
SR proteins in exon 4 is weak and too far away for SR to enhance U2AF
binding (Figure 7.12). In the presence of tra and tra-2, however, the interaction of SR with the exon 4 sequence is stabilized, allowing SR in turn to
promote binding of U2AF and splicing of exon 3 to exon 4 (Figure 7.12). As
well as an RNA-binding domain found in many RNA-binding proteins with
different functions (see above), the SR proteins and tra/tra-2 also contain
the domain rich in serine (S) and arginine (R) residues which gives the SR
proteins their name.
Overall therefore, alternative splicing involves the interaction of a number
of factors including both sequences within the RNA itself and constitutively
expressed or tissue-specific trans-acting protein factors. Each splice site
within the RNA will have a particular strength depending on several factors.
The first of these will be its ability to bind general splicing factors, such as the
U1 snRNP or U2AF, with those sites which bind these factors more strongly
being stronger splice sites (Figure 7.13a). Second, the strength of a splice
site will depend on the presence or absence of ESEs (Figure 7.13b). Third,
there will also be an effect of position, i.e. whether the splicing event involves
a proximal or distal downstream exon (Figure 7.13c).

FIGURE 7.11
sR proteins such as sF2 can stimulate the use
of a particular splice site either by binding to
the 5′ splice site and promoting binding of the
u1 snRNP to this site (a) or by binding to the
downstream exon sequence and promoting
recruitment of u2AF and hence of the u2
snRNP to the branch point (b).

Which splicing event actually occurs in a particular tissue or cell type
will then be determined both by these features of the competing splice sites
and the presence or absence of tissue- or cell type-specific splicing factors,
and/or the relative levels and post-translational modification of different
constitutively expressed factors involved in splicing (Figure 7.13).

The processes of transcription and alternative splicing interact
with one another
It is clear therefore that alternative splicing is a process that is influenced
both by features of the RNA itself and by factors that interact with it. However,
as discussed in Chapter 6 (Section 6.4), the process of splicing is closely
linked to transcription itself and this is another factor which needs to be
considered.
It is likely that transcriptional events can affect alternative splicing by at
least two mechanisms. The first of these involves regulation of the rate of
transcriptional elongation. Since the splicing complex is recruited to the
RNA by the C-terminal domain of the RPB1 subunit of RNA polymerase II

while transcription is still occurring, the rate of transcriptional elongation
can influence which alternative splicing event occurs.
In a situation where an upstream 3′ splice site is weaker than a downstream one, a low rate of transcriptional elongation will favor the use of the
weaker site since it can be used before the downstream site has even been
transcribed. In contrast, with a faster rate of transcriptional elongation, both
splice sites will be present in the RNA transcript that is being spliced, resulting in the stronger splice site being used (Figure 7.14). Interestingly, the
Hu splicing regulator promotes histone hyperacetylation (see Chapter 3,
Section 3.3) by inhibiting histone deacetylase enzymes. In turn, this
enhances the rate of transcriptional elongation at specific genes resulting in
specific exons being spliced out of the resulting RNA.
The alternative method by which transcription and alternative splicing
are coupled is also based on the recruitment of splicing factors while transcription is still occurring. Different splicing factors could be recruited by
the transcription complex under different conditions, so resulting in different alternative splicing patterns (Figure 7.15).
As with transcriptional elongation, the recruitment of splicing factors
can also be affected by histone modification. Thus, it has been shown that
as well as opening up the chromatin structure, methylation of histone H3 on
lysine 36 also enhances the recruitment of the polypyrimidine tract-binding
protein (PTB) alternative splicing factors (see Chapter 10, Section 10.2),
thereby promoting specific alternative splicing events.
Thus, alternative splicing can be regulated by the linkage between transcription and splicing. As noted in Chapter 6 (Section 6.4 and Figure 6.23),
it is possible for introns to be spliced out post-transcriptionally as well as

co-transcriptionally. In the case of the Sxl protein which differentially regulates the splicing of its own mRNA in males and females (see above and
Figure 7.5) this process is differentially regulated in a manner which regulates alternative splicing. It has been shown that in male Drosophila exons
2, 3, and 4 are spliced together co-transcriptionally. In contrast, in females
this does not occur with introns 2 and 3, and exon 3 is removed and exons
2 and 4 joined together only after transcription has ceased (Figure 7.16).
In summary, therefore, the outcome of alternative splicing in different
cell types or tissues will depend on a number of factors such as sequences
in the RNA itself, the presence or absence of particular splicing factors, their
concentration and their post-translational modification, as well as the interaction of the splicing processes with other events such as transcription.

Alternative RNA splicing is a very widely used method of
supplementing transcriptional control
The cases discussed above indicate the use of alternative splicing in a wide
variety of biological processes. In mammals, such splicing has been shown
to regulate processes as diverse as the circadian biological clock and the
different forms of several of the major sarcomere muscle proteins. Similarly,
in Drosophila much of the posterior body plan is determined by developmentally regulated differential splicing of the ultrabithorax gene, while sex
determination is also controlled by differential splicing of a hierarchy of
genes in males and females (see above).
Moreover, alternative splicing is also used in plants, as well as in animals. For example, in Arabidopsis thaliana, flowering occurs when the
plant is grown at high temperature (typically 27°C) but not at lower temperatures (typically 16°C). This is controlled at least in part by alternative splicing of the FLM (Flowering locus M) transcription factor, a member of the
MADS family of transcription factors (see Chapter 10, Section 10.1, for
discussion of this family). At low temperatures the FLM RNA transcript is
spliced to produce an mRNA encoding the FLM-β form of the protein, which
binds to DNA and recruits the SVP transcriptional repressor, so inhibiting
the transcription of genes encoding flowering activators (Figure 7.17) (see
Chapter 5, Section 5.3, for discussion of transcriptional repressors). In contrast, this effect does not occur at higher temperatures, where alternative
splicing produces an mRNA encoding the non-DNA-binding FLM-δ form of
the protein (Figure 7.17).

those genes and preventing flowering. in
contrast, the FlM-δ form produced at higher
temperatures does not bind to DNA and
so the flowering genes are transcribed,
allowing flowering to occur.

Although initially these cases were defined by identifying a gene of interest in a particular process and then showing that it was alternatively spliced,
the generality of alternative splicing has now been demonstrated by
genome-wide methods. For example, the microarray systems used to study
global gene expression patterns which were described in Chapter 1 (Section
1.2), can be adapted to investigate alternative splicing events. If mRNA
from different tissues is used to probe an array containing oligonucleotides derived from various exons, their presence or absence in the mRNA
can be determined by the pattern of hybridization (Figure 7.18).
The use of methods of this type, using sequences of thousands of human
genes, has allowed the conclusion mentioned earlier that over 90% of
human genes with multiple exons exhibit alternative splicing in different
situations. Moreover, when linked to studies identifying the RNA-binding
sites of specific regulators of alternative splicing (see above and Figure 7.9)
they can be used to both identify alternative splicing events and analyze the
way in which they are regulated.
The widespread use of alternative splicing in mammals does not refute
the conclusion discussed in Chapter 1 (Section 1.4), that gene regulation
occurs primarily at the level of transcription. Clearly, alternative splicing
represents a response to a requirement for the production of related but
different forms of a gene product in different tissues. It therefore supplements the regulation of transcription of the gene responsible for producing
the different forms. Thus, for example the transcription of the troponin T
gene is confined to differentiated muscle cells, with alternative splicing producing multiple different isoforms in different muscle cell types.
Indeed, a genome-wide analysis of the proteins produced by alternative
splicing in species as diverse as humans and Drosophila indicated that such
alternative splicing inserts or deletes whole functional domains of proteins
more often than would be expected by chance. Moreover, the domains
inserted or deleted in this way are frequently involved in regulating the interaction of the protein with other proteins. This general analysis reinforces the
key role of alternative splicing in producing distinct but related proteins
which differ in their precise role and their interaction with other proteins.
Interestingly, it has recently been demonstrated by comparing various
animal species that tissue-specific alternative splicing events appear to
change more rapidly during evolution than do transcription patterns, suggesting that changes in these events producing different forms of specific
proteins may play a key role in the production of new species.
As well as controlling the insertion or exclusion of specific functional
domains, alternative splicing can also regulate the balance between

functional and nonfunctional mRNAs. For example, the inclusion of a particular exon in the mRNA can result in it containing a premature stop codon
whereas exclusion of this exon results in a functional mRNA (Figure 7.19).
As described in Chapter 6 (Section 6.7), such a premature stop codon will
result in the degradation of the RNA by nonsense-mediated decay processes.
In this manner, alternative splicing can be used to control the level of a
particular protein, in a manner similar to but distinct from the process
versus discard decisions which occur, for example, in Drosophila, as
described above (compare Figure 7.1 and Figure 7.19).
This method of controlling the amount of a functional protein by alternative splicing is frequently used to regulate the amount of alternative splicing factors themselves. For example, as discussed in Chapter 10 (Section
10.2), functional nPTB protein is produced only in mammalian neuronal
cells where it regulates neuronal-specific alternative splicing events.
However, the nPTB gene is also transcribed in non-neuronal cells.
Alternative splicing of the nPTB primary transcript produces an mRNA containing a premature stop codon in non-neuronal cells, but produces a functional mRNA in neuronal cells.
Interestingly, all types of alternative splicing are particularly common in
nondividing cells such as muscle cells and nerve cells. As discussed in
Chapter 3 (Section 3.2), the reprogramming of cellular commitment and
gene transcription often requires a cell division event allowing alterations in
the chromatin structure of the DNA and its associated proteins to occur.
Alternative splicing may therefore represent a means of conveniently
changing the pattern of protein production in cells where such reprogramming cannot be achieved by cell division.

7.2

REGULATION OF POLYADENYLATION

Both the amount and the site of polyadenylation
can be regulated
As discussed in Chapter 6 (Section 6.2), after the primary transcript has been
produced it is rapidly cleaved and a poly(A) tail added, and this process of
polyadenylation is important for both the stability of the mRNA and its
translation into protein. Hence, regulating the amount of polyadenylation of
a specific mRNA can regulate gene expression at the level of RNA stability
or translation (Figure 7.20).
An example of this is seen following exposure of cells to elevated
temperature or heat shock. As discussed in Chapter 3 (Section 3.5) and

Chapter 4 (Section 4.3), such treatment results in the transcriptional induction of the heat-shock genes whose protein products protect cells from the
stress of elevated temperature. However, it is also accompanied by the
repression of non-heat-shock genes as the cell focuses its resources on
dealing with the stress. This repression is achieved in part by inhibiting the
polyadenylation of mRNAs derived from non-heat-shock genes.
As discussed in Chapter 6 (Section 6.2) the free 3′ end of the mRNA generated by endonucleolytic cleavage is polyadenylated by the enzyme poly(A)
polymerase. This enzyme is associated with another enzyme, known as
poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase 1 (PARP1). Following heat shock PARP1
becomes activated and modifies the poly(A) polymerase (and PARP1 itself)
by the addition of polyADP-ribose molecules. This has the effect of inhibiting the poly(A) polymerase enzyme so that no polyadenylation occurs following 3′ cleavage of the mRNA (Figure 7.21).
Regulation of polyadenylation is also seen when Xenopus oocytes are
activated from a dormant state, with a number of mRNAs exhibiting
enhanced polyadenylation, which in turn releases a block on their translation into protein (see Section 7.6 and Figure 7.57). Similarly, two different
classes of small RNAs, miRNAs and piRNAs, can inhibit gene expression by
binding to an mRNA target and inducing its deadenylation and subsequent
rapid degradation (see Section 7.7 and Figure 7.62).
As well as affecting the degree of polyadenylation of a specific RNA, regulatory processes can also regulate the site at which polyadenylation occurs,
so that different cleavage sites are used in different cell types thereby producing polyadenylated mRNAs of different lengths (Figure 7.22).
In many cases, this alternative polyadenylation will not affect the
protein encoded by the mRNA but will alter the length of the 3′ untranslated region (3′ UTR) of the mRNA. This can still produce functional
effects, with the shorter of the two mRNAs lacking a binding site for an
RNA-binding protein or an miRNA which in turn affects the stability of the
mRNA or its translatability (Figure 7.22) (see Sections 7.5–7.7). Interestingly,
the use of alternative polyadenylation to produce mRNAs with different
length 3′ UTRs has recently been shown to be particularly prevalent in RNAs
from genes which are transcribed in all cell types. Thus, in many such ubiquitously transcribed RNAs, tissue-specific alternative polyadenylation is
used to produce different mRNAs with, for example, different stabilities or
different translatability in different cell types.

Alternative polyadenylation can lead to alternative splicing
In other cases however, alternative polyadenylation can produce mRNAs
which encode different proteins. This can occur, for example, because the
different RNAs produced by alternative polyadenylation are then differentially spliced.

polymerase (PAP) polyadenylates the free
3′ end of the RNA produced by 3′ cleavage

ribase to both itself and PAP. This inactivates
PAP, preventing polyadenylation following 3′
cleavage of the RNA (b).

A well-characterized example of this process occurs in the genes encoding the immunoglobulin heavy chain of the antibody molecule and plays an
important role in the regulation of the antibody response to infection. Early
in the immune response, the antibody-producing B cell synthesizes membrane-bound immunoglobulin molecules whose interaction with antigen
triggers proliferation of the B cell and results in the production of more
antibody-synthesizing cells. However, the immunoglobulin produced by
these cells is secreted and can interact with antigen in tissue fluids, triggering the activation of other cells in the immune system.
The production of membrane-bound and secreted immunoglobin molecules occurs due to alternative polyadenylation followed by the alternative
splicing of the different RNA molecules differing in their 3′ ends (Figure 7.23).
The longer of these two molecules contains two exons encoding the portion of
the protein that anchors it in the membrane. When this molecule is spliced
both these two exons are included but a region encoding the last 20 amino
acids of the secreted form is omitted. In the shorter RNA, the two transmembrane domain-encoding exons are absent and the region specific to the
secreted form is included in the final messenger RNA.
If the polyadenylation site used in the production of the shorter immunoglobulin RNA is artificially removed preventing its use, the expected
decrease in the production of secreted immunoglobulin is paralleled by a
corresponding increase in the synthesis of the membrane-bound form of
the protein (Figure 7.24a). This indicates that the choice of splicing

pattern is controlled by which polyadenylation site is used; removal of the

increased production of the mRNA encoding the membrane-bound form.
This switch in the polyadenylation site is dependent on an increase in
concentration of one of the subunits of the polyadenylation factor, CstF (see
Chapter 6, Section 6.2), which occurs during B-cell development. CstF binds
preferentially to the poly(A) site of the mRNA encoding the membrane form
compared with that of the secreted form. Early in B-cell development when
CstF levels are low, it binds to the poly(A) site for the membrane form and
so this mRNA is produced. As the levels of CstF rise, binding and cleavage
occur at the poly(A) site for the secreted mRNA (Figure 7.25).

it also binds at the weaker secreted poly(A)
site, leading to loss of exons M1 and M2 by
cleavage of the mRNA. The rise in the level
of cstF that occurs in B-cell development
therefore results in a switch from the
membrane-bound to the secreted form.

This finding indicates that in cases of this type, the primary regulatory
event is that determining the site of cleavage and polyadenylation and that
alternative RNA splicing is regulated by differences in the transcript produced in different tissues.
Interestingly however, not all cases of alternative RNA splicing of RNAs
with alternative polyadenylation sites are of this type. This conclusion has
emerged from studies of the gene encoding the calcium regulatory protein,
calcitonin. When the gene encoding the calcitonin protein (which is a small
peptide of 32 amino acids) was isolated it was found that it also had the
potential to produce an RNA encoding an entirely different peptide of 36
amino acids, which was named calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP).
Unlike calcitonin, which is produced in the thyroid gland, CGRP is produced
in specific neurons within the brain and peripheral nervous system. These
two peptides are produced by alternative splicing of two distinct transcripts
differing in their 3′ ends (Figure 7.26).
This case differs from that of the immunoglobulin heavy chain, however,
in that deletion of the polyadenylation site used in the shorter, calcitoninencoding, RNA does not result in an increase in CGRP expression in cells
normally expressing calcitonin. Instead, large unspliced transcripts utilizing
the downstream (CGRP) polyadenylation site accumulate in these cells
(Figure 7.24b). Although in CGRP-producing cells such transcripts would
normally be spliced to yield CGRP messenger RNA, this does not occur in
these experiments in cells normally producing calcitonin and these unspliced
precursors accumulate. This indicates that in the calcitonin/CGRP gene the
use of different polyadenylation sites is secondary to the difference in RNA
splicing, and is regulated by the tissue-specific splicing factors whose presence or absence in a specific tissue determines the pattern of calcitonin/CGRP
RNA splicing (see Section 7.1 for discussion of such factors).
Although regulation of polyadenylation is not the primary regulatory
event in the calcitonin/CGRP case, it is clear that it is of primary importance in many other cases. Moreover, it can have a key regulatory role
either by leading to the production of mRNAs encoding different proteins
or subject to different patterns of regulation at the level of mRNA stability
of translatability.

7.3 RNA EDITING
Some cases of RNA editing involve a change from
a C to a U residue
The finding that two different protein products can be produced from the
same RNA by alternative splicing has been supplemented by the observation that a similar result can be achieved by a post-transcriptional sequence
change in the messenger RNA.

This is seen in the case of the apolipoprotein B protein, which plays an
important role in lipid transport and is known to exist in two closely
related forms. A large protein of 512 kDa known as apo-B100 is synthesized by the liver while a smaller protein, apo-B48, is made by the intestine. The smaller protein is identical to the amino-terminal portion of the
larger protein. Analysis of the mRNA encoding these proteins revealed a
14.5 kb RNA in both tissues. These two RNAs were identical with the
exception of a single base at position 6666 which is a cytosine in the liver
transcript and a uracil in the intestinal transcript (Figure 7.27). This
change has the effect of replacing a CAA codon, which directs the insertion of a glutamine residue, with a UAA stop codon which causes termination of translation of the intestine RNA and hence results in the smaller
protein being made.
Only one gene encoding these proteins is present in the genome and it
is not alternatively spliced. In both intestinal and liver DNA, this gene has
a cytosine residue at position 6666. Hence the uracil in the intestinal
transcript must be introduced by a post-transcriptional RNA editing
mechanism.
Indeed, a cytidine deaminase enzyme has been identified and shown to
bind to the apoB mRNA at sequences adjacent to the edited site. This
enzyme removes an amine (NH2) group from the cytosine residue generating a uracil. The editing enzyme is expressed in the intestine where editing
of the apoB mRNA occurs but not in the liver where editing does not occur.
Interestingly however, it is also present in other tissues such as the testis,
ovary, and spleen where apoB mRNA is not expressed. This indicates that
this enzyme edits other transcripts expressed in these tissues. Indeed, several other transcripts which undergo C to U editing have been identified and
a number of different cytidine deaminase enzymes capable of carrying out
this form of editing have been characterized.

Many cases of RNA editing involve a change from
A to an I residue
As well as C to U editing by cytidine deaminase, an adenosine deaminase
enzyme also exists in mammalian cells. This enzyme removes an amino
residue from adenine to produce an inosine base that is read as a guanine
residue by the translation apparatus. This form of editing is particularly
prevalent in humans, where it is believed to affect over 1000 genes.
It was first identified in the gene encoding a receptor for the excitatory
amino acid glutamate which is expressed in neuronal cells. The editing
of an A residue to an I (G) residue in the transcript of this gene results in
it encoding an arginine rather than the glutamine found in other related
receptors and alters its properties so that it is permeable to calcium.
Interestingly, this editing of the glutamate receptor mRNA is essential for
the survival of the animal. Mice lacking the adenosine deaminase enzyme
(ADAR2) which carries out this editing are prone to seizures and die young.
However, their survival can be restored to normal by inserting a glutamate
receptor gene in which the alteration produced by editing has been carried
out at the DNA level, removing the need for editing at the RNA level
(Figure 7.28).
Although the glutamate receptor is therefore a critical target for RNA
editing, editing by adenosine deamination is widespread, especially in the

nervous system, and also occurs in other neuronally expressed receptors
such as the kainate receptors and the serotonin receptor. Indeed, a comprehensive search for edited transcripts in Drosophila identified 16 previously
unidentified targets for A to I editing. Interestingly, all of these were involved
in electrical or chemical neurotransmission and the editing event targeted a
functionally important residue. Hence, A to I editing plays a critical role in
the nervous system in producing different functional variants of molecules
involved in neuronal signaling.
As well as affecting the nature of the protein produced from a particular
mRNA, A to I editing by adenosine deaminase enzymes can also affect the
splicing of the edited RNA. This is seen in the case of the gene encoding the
ADAR2 adenosine deaminase enzyme itself. The ADAR2 transcript contains
an AA sequence 47 bases upstream of the AG sequence which is normally
used as a 3′ splice site. Editing of the AA sequence to AI (which mimics AG)
creates a new 3′ splice site which is used for splicing, resulting in the 47-base
sequence being retained in the mRNA (Figure 7.29).
This case is of particular interest in that the editing event results in a
nonfunctional ADAR2 protein being produced due to the inclusion in the
mRNA of a premature translational stop codon, leading to nonsensemediated decay of the mRNA (see Chapter 6, Section 6.7 and this chapter,
Section 7.1). It therefore appears to represent a mechanism for ADAR2 to
autoregulate its own production, with editing of its own mRNA by the
enzyme limiting the amount of ADAR2 protein which is made. Moreover,
this editing event is regulated so that it occurs frequently in the brain and
lung where ADAR2 transcripts predominantly contain the 47-base extra
exon. In contrast, it occurs much less frequently in the heart where this
exon is therefore absent from the mRNA. This effect also demonstrates that
editing by adenosine deaminase can affect RNA splicing as well as altering
the encoded protein and that it can affect the RNA encoding the adenosine
deaminase itself, as well as RNAs encoding other proteins such as the glutamate receptor.
A to I editing can therefore target protein-coding mRNAs to alter the
encoded protein or the splicing pattern. In addition however, the A to I editing process can also target the micro RNAs (miRNAs) that were discussed in
Chapter 1 (Section 1.5) and which play a key role in the regulation of gene
expression. In this case, A to I editing alters the sequence of the miRNA and
therefore results in its binding (by complementary base pairing) to a different set of target mRNAs.

extra 47 bases being retained in the final
mRNA. This results in the presence in the
mRNA of a premature stop codon, leading to
nonsense-mediated decay of the mRNA (b).

252

Chapter 7: Post-transcriptional Regulation

Moreover, this effect is a tissue-specific one. For example, the miRNA
miR376-a, undergoes A to I editing in the mouse kidney but not in the
liver. This alters the target mRNAs to which it can bind, since the A residue
in the unedited miRNA needs to base pair with a U residue in the target
mRNA, whereas the I in the edited miRNA will base pair with a C residue
(Figure 7.30). Sequence analysis suggests that the unedited miRNA can
bind to 78 target genes while the edited miRNA binds to 82 target genes,
with only 2 target genes being bound by both the unedited and edited
forms. Since binding of an miRNA to its target mRNAs results in inhibition
of gene expression (see Section 7.7), A to I editing will result in miR376-a
inhibiting a different set of genes in the kidney compared with the liver.
The existence of two distinct types of editing enzymes (adenosine deaminase and cytidine deaminase) in mammalian cells, each with multiple substrates, indicates that this represents a widely used mechanism which like
alternative splicing can produce related but distinct proteins from the same
transcript. As with alternative splicing however, this is likely to act as a supplement to transcriptional control. The apoB gene for example, is transcribed in the liver and the intestine but not in other tissues, while many of
the targets for A to I editing are transcribed only in the nervous system.
Interestingly, as well as these similarities in the role/outcome of RNA editing and alternative splicing, there is evidence that the two processes may
occur in parallel. For example, it has been shown that the adenosine deaminase enzyme is found in large ribonucleoprotein particles which also contain Sm and SR splicing factors.

7.4

REGULATION OF RNA TRANSPORT

Specific proteins can regulate the transport of individual
mRNAs from nucleus to cytoplasm
The process of RNA splicing takes place within the nucleus whereas the
machinery for translating the spliced RNA is found in the cytoplasm. The
spliced mRNA must therefore be transported to the cytoplasm if it is to
direct protein synthesis (see Chapter 6, Section 6.5). The first example of
regulation at this level was described in the human immunodeficiency
virus (HIV-1).
Early in infection of cells with HIV, the virus produces a high level of very
short nonfunctional transcripts and a small amount of full-length functional
RNA. The full-length RNA is spliced with the removal of two introns so that
the predominant transcript that appears in the cytoplasm is a fully spliced
mRNA (Figure 7.31). This transcript encodes the regulatory proteins Tat
and Rev. As discussed in Chapter 5 (Section 5.4), the Tat protein acts to
greatly increase the rate of transcription of the viral genome, as well as promoting transcriptional elongation so that predominantly full-length RNAs
are produced in the nucleus. However, at this second stage of infection
most of the mRNAs that appear in the cytoplasm are either unspliced or
have had only the first intron removed (Figure 7.31). As these transcripts
encode the viral structural proteins, this allows the high-level production of
viral particles that is necessary late in infection.
This change in the nature of the HIV RNA in the cytoplasm is dependent
on the action of the Rev protein which is made early in infection. Most
interestingly, Rev does not affect the amounts of the different RNAs in the
nucleus. Rather it is an RNA-binding protein and binds to a specific site
(the Rev response element) in the second intron of the HIV transcripts.
This binding promotes the transport of these RNAs to the cytoplasm
(Figure 7.32). As the fully spliced RNA lacks the Rev-binding site, its
transport is not accelerated and so the proportion of unspliced or singly
spliced RNA in the cytoplasm increases. Hence, Rev acts at the level of
RNA transport and was the first regulatory protein identified as acting at
this stage.
The Rev protein resembles several cellular RNA transport proteins in
containing a nuclear export signal (NES) rich in leucine residues, which

Regulation of HiV gene expression. early in infection a low level of transcriptional initiation

enhances both the initiation and elongation of transcription, resulting in an increase
in the production of the viral RNA. The Rev protein then acts post-transcriptionally to
promote splicing/transport so the unspliced and singly spliced RNAs encoding the viral
structural proteins (gag, env) and the reverse transcriptase (Pol) accumulate.

promotes transport of the RNA to which it has bound from the nucleus to
the cytoplasm. Moreover, Rev has been shown to bind to a cellular nuclear
export protein which is localized in the pores of the nuclear membrane and
this interaction is likely to play a key role in its ability to mediate export of
the HIV RNA (Figure 7.33). These findings indicate that Rev mediates RNA
export via a cellular pathway, involving the NES signal which Rev shares
with cellular RNA transport proteins.
It is likely therefore that as well as the examples of constitutive RNA
transport discussed in Chapter 6 (Section 6.5), there are also situations in
which this system is used to regulate the transport of specific cellular
mRNAs in different tissues or in response to specific stimuli. This would,
for example, provide a convenient explanation of the existence of RNA
species that are confined to the nucleus in specific tissues of the sea
urchin but are transported to the cytoplasm in other tissues (see
Introduction to this chapter). Similarly, a mechanism which prevented the
transport of unspliced RNA in genes regulated by processing versus
discard decisions (see Section 7.1) would represent a means of preventing
wasteful translation of RNA species containing interruptions in the
­protein-coding sequence.

Chapter 7: Post-transcriptional Regulation

RNA transport processes can also regulate the location
of individual mRNAs within the cytoplasm
As well as controlling the transport of mRNA from the nucleus to the cytoplasm (Figure 7.34a) it is also possible for regulatory processes to control
the location of an mRNA species within the cytoplasm of a polarized cell,
resulting in the corresponding protein being made only in certain parts of
the cell (Figure 7.34b).
This process is observed for example, within the oocyte (egg) resulting in
different proteins being localized in different regions of the egg. Following
fertilization, this differential distribution of proteins in turn controls embryonic development so that different regions of the embryo develop from
different regions of the fertilized egg. For example, in Drosophila the bicoid
mRNA is located at the anterior end of the egg while the nanos mRNA is
localized to the posterior end. The resulting opposite gradients of the Bicoid
and Nanos proteins in turn control the polarity of the head, thorax, and
abdomen of the embryo, so that different regions of the body are produced
depending on the relative concentrations of the two proteins (Figure 7.35).
(See Chapter 9, Section 9.2 for further discussion of the processes controlling embryonic development in Drosophila).
The specific localization of the bicoid and nanos mRNAs in the fertilized
Drosophila egg is not an isolated example. In a recent study of more than
3000 mRNA species in the Drosophila embryo, over 70% showed specific
subcellular localizations rather than exhibiting a uniform distribution within
the cell. Similarly, in mammals, approximately 400 mRNAs are targeted to
the multiple dendritic processes of neuronal cells.
In many cases, such as the bicoid mRNA, specific sequences have
been localized in the 3′ untranslated region of the mRNA which are
essential for correct localization and which can confer the bicoid pattern of localization on a nonlocalized mRNA. These sequences in the 3′
untranslated region of the bicoid mRNA are essential for it to bind both
the Staufen protein and a protein complex known ESCRT-II, to form a
ribonucleoprotein complex. In turn, recruitment of these proteins is
essential for movement of the bicoid mRNA to the anterior end of the
egg (Figure 7.36a). Interestingly, the Staufen protein is also expressed
in mammalian neurons and appears to play a critical role in directing
specific mRNAs to the multiple dendritic processes of the neuron and
excluding them from the single axon (Figure 7.36b). Hence, Staufen

plays a key role in directing specific mRNAs to particular parts of the cell
in very different cell types and in widely different organisms.

RNA localization can be linked to other stages
of gene expression
As with the bicoid mRNA, initial studies also identified the 3′ untranslated
region of the oskar mRNA as being important for its localization in the
egg, although the oskar mRNA localizes to the posterior rather than the
anterior region. However, it has been shown that correct localization of
the oskar mRNA in the cytoplasm is also dependent on the splicing of the
first two exons of the oskar transcript in the nucleus. An artificial oskar
RNA with the first two exons already joined together (so that splicing is not
required) is not correctly localized even though the mRNA is indistinguishable from one produced by splicing and contains the 3′ untranslated region
(Figure 7.37).
This effect is dependent upon the linkage between RNA splicing and
transport to the cytoplasm which was discussed in Chapter 6. During
splicing, a protein complex known as the exon junction complex (EJC)
binds to each exon just upstream of the junction between two adjacent
exons and is transported to the cytoplasm bound to the mRNA (see
Chapter 6, Section 6.7). In the case of the oskar RNA the binding of the EJC
to the first exon recruits another protein known as Barentsz which is
responsible for the correct localization of the oskar mRNA (Figure 7.38),
so explaining how the splicing process is necessary for correct mRNA
localization.
It is also possible for RNA localization to be determined co-transcriptionally
while the RNA is actually being transcribed. For example, in budding yeast,
the Ste2 protein binds to RNA polymerase II which is transcribing a wide
variety of different genes. Where the RNA transcript contains a specific target sequence, Ste2 then moves from the RNA polymerase II and binds to its
target sequence. It then promotes localization of these RNAs to the yeast
bud tip (Figure 7.39).
Hence, regulatory proteins such as Staufen, Barentsz, and Ste2 play a
key role in localizing specific mRNAs to particular locations within the cell

and these processes can be coupled to transcription and RNA splicing.
Evidently, the aim of this process is to ensure that the protein corresponding
to the mRNA is made only in the appropriate subcellular location where it is
required. Translation of the mRNA must therefore be prevented while it is
being transported through the cytoplasm to the correct place in the cell. For
example, if production of the Bicoid protein occurred as soon as its mRNA
entered the cytoplasm, it would induce inappropriate anterior structures in
the wrong place.
Interestingly, in the case of the oskar mRNA discussed above, it has been
shown that the PTB protein represses its translation until it reaches the correct point in the cell. The PTB protein is also involved in the regulation of
alternative splicing (see Chapter 10, Section 10.2), producing a further link
between RNA splicing and RNA transport. Similarly, the β-actin mRNA is
transported to the tips of neuronal processes in protein–RNA granules which
prevent its translation. When synaptic activity involving these neuronal processes occurs, the β-actin mRNA is released from the granule and is available for translation by the ribosome.

7.5

REGULATION OF RNA STABILITY

Gene regulation can involve alterations in RNA stability
Once the mRNA has entered the cytoplasm, the number of times that it is
translated and hence the amount of protein it produces will be determined
by its stability. The more rapidly degraded an RNA is, the less protein it
will produce. Indeed, it is now clear that the rate of turnover of an mRNA
plays an important role in determining its level in the cell (see Chapter 6,
Section 6.7).
An effective means of gene regulation could be achieved by changing
the stability of an RNA species in response to a regulatory signal. A number
of situations where the stability of a specific RNA species is changed in this
way have been described. For example, the mRNA for the milk protein,

FIGURE 7.39
in yeast, the ste2 protein binds to RNA
polymerase ii (RNAP) while it is transcribing
a wide variety of different RNAs. Where the
transcribed RNA contains a binding site for
ste2 (x in RNA 2), the ste2 protein moves
from the RNA polymerase to bind to the RNA
target sequence and directs the localization
of this RNA to the yeast bud.

REGULATION OF RNA STABILITY

Specific sequences in the mRNA are involved in the
regulation of its stability
The first stage in defining the mechanism of changes in RNA stability is to
identify the sequences within the RNA that are involved in mediating the
observed alterations. This can be achieved by transferring parts of the gene
encoding the RNA under study to another gene and observing the effect on
the stability of the RNA expressed from the resulting hybrid gene. In a number of cases, short regions have been identified which can confer the pattern
of stability regulation of the donor gene upon a recipient gene that is not
normally regulated in this manner.
In many cases such regions are located in the 3′ untranslated region of the
mRNA, downstream of the stop codon that terminates production of the protein. For example, the cell cycle-dependent regulation of histone H3 mRNA
stability is controlled by a 30-nucleotide sequence at the extreme 3′ end of the
molecule. Similarly, the destabilization of the mRNA encoding the transferrin
receptor in response to the presence of iron can be abolished by deletion of a
60-nucleotide sequence within the 3′ untranslated region. Interestingly, both
of these sequences have the potential to form stem-loop structures by intramolecular base pairing (Figure 7.41), suggesting that changes in stability are
likely to be brought about by alterations in the folding of this region of the
RNA in response to a specific signal (see Chapter 6, Section 6.2).
The localization of sequences involved in the regulated degradation of
specific mRNA species to the 3′ untranslated region is in agreement with the
important role of this region in determining the differences in stability
observed between different RNA species, for example, by promoting loss of
the poly(A) tail catalyzed by specific deadenylation enzymes. In turn, this
would open up the RNA to exonucleolytic attack via its free 3′ end (see
Chapter 6, Section 6.7). This suggests that differences in RNA stability,
whether between different RNA species or in a single RNA in different situations, may be controlled primarily by this region.
Despite this, cases where other regions of the RNA mediate the observed
alterations in stability have also been described. The most extensively studied of such cases concerns the autoregulation of the mRNA encoding the
microtubule protein, β-tubulin, in response to the presence of free tubulin
monomers. This autoregulation prevents the wasteful synthesis of tubulin
when excess free tubulin not polymerized into microtubules is present and
is caused by a destabilization of the tubulin mRNA. A short sequence only
13 bases in length from the 5′ end of the β-tubulin mRNA is responsible for
this destabilization and can confer the response on an unrelated mRNA.
Most interestingly, these bases actually encode the first four amino acids
of the tubulin protein. This raises the possibility that the trigger for degradation of the tubulin mRNA might be the recognition of these amino acids in
the tubulin protein rather than the corresponding nucleotides in the tubulin

casein, turns over with a half-life of around 1 hour in untreated mammary
gland cells. Following stimulation with the hormone prolactin, the half-life
increases to over 40 hours, resulting in increased accumulation of casein
mRNA and protein production in response to the hormone (Figure 7.40).
Similarly, the increased production of the DNA-associated histone proteins
in the S (DNA synthesis) phase of the cell cycle is regulated in part by a fivefold increase in histone mRNA stability that occurs in this phase of the cell
cycle (see Chapter 6, Section 6.2).
Such regulation of RNA stability is not confined to isolated cases. In over
50% of cases where the abundance of an mRNA transcript altered in human
cells in response to stress, at least a part of the change was due to altered
RNA stability. Interestingly, a similar genome-wide survey of all cellular
mRNAs in yeast demonstrated that regulation at the level of mRNA stability
was frequently observed for mRNAs whose corresponding proteins are
involved in rRNA synthesis and ribosome production. Hence, this form of
regulation may be particularly frequent for genes encoding proteins involved
in the process of protein synthesis itself.

RNA. In agreement with this idea, changing the translational reading
frame of this region such that the identical nucleotide sequence encoded a
different amino acid sequence abolished the autoregulatory response
(Figure 7.42a). In contrast, changing the nucleotide sequence in a manner
which did not alter the encoded amino acids (due to the degeneracy of the
genetic code) left the response intact (Figure 7.42b).
Hence, stability of the RNA transcript can be regulated by sequences in
different parts of the RNA which can be recognized at the level of the RNA
itself or of the protein which it encodes. Interestingly, in some cases it has
been shown that the gene promoter, rather than any sequence in the RNA
itself, is responsible for a particular regulatory pattern of RNA degradation.
For example in yeast, the SWI5 RNA is subject to regulated degradation during the cell cycle whereas the ACT1 RNA is not. Exchanging the promoters of
the two genes results in an ACT1 RNA which is subject to cell cycle-regulated
degradation and an SWI5 RNA which is not subject to such regulation.
Hence, the same RNA species is regulated differently when transcribed from
different promoters. This is likely to involve different transcriptional complexes assembling at the different promoters, with these complexes differing
in their ability to recruit a factor which then binds to the RNA and regulates
its degradation (Figure 7.43).
This example therefore provides a further link between transcription and
post-transcriptional processes that was discussed in Chapter 6 (Section 6.4)
and in earlier sections of this chapter. It also indicates that the degradation
of an RNA can be regulated by DNA sequences outside the transcribed
region as well as RNA sequences within it.

RNA stability changes supplement transcriptional control in
cases where a rapid response is required
A consideration of the situations where changes in the stability of a particular RNA occur suggests that the majority have two features in common.
First, changes in stability of a particular mRNA are very often accompanied
by parallel alterations in the transcription rate of the corresponding gene.
For example, prolactin treatment of mammary gland cells results in a twoto fourfold increase in casein gene transcription. Similarly, the increased
stability of histone mRNA in the S phase of the cell cycle is accompanied by
a three- to fivefold increase in transcription of the histone genes.
Second, cases where RNA stability is regulated are very often those
where a rapid and transient change in the synthesis of a particular protein
is required. For example, synthesis of the histone proteins is necessary only

at one particular phase of the cell cycle, when DNA is being synthesized.
Following cessation of DNA synthesis, a rapid shut-off in the synthesis of
unnecessary histone proteins is required. Similarly, following the cessation
of hormonal stimulation it would be highly wasteful to continue the synthesis of hormonally dependent proteins, such as casein or vitellogenin.
In the case of the cellular oncogene c-myc, whose RNA stability is transiently increased when cells are stimulated to grow, such continued synthesis would not only be highly wasteful but is also potentially dangerous
to the cell. This growth-regulatory protein is only required for a short
period when cells are entering the growth phase and its continued inappropriate synthesis at other times carries the risk of disrupting cellular
growth-regulatory mechanisms, possibly resulting in transition to a cancerous state (see Chapter 11, Sections 11.1 and 11.2).
These considerations suggest that alterations in RNA stability are used
as a significant supplement to transcriptional control in cases where rapid
changes in the synthesis of a particular protein are required. Thus, if transcription is shut off in response to withdrawal of a particular signal, inappropriate and metabolically expensive protein synthesis will continue for
some time from preexisting mRNA unless that RNA is degraded rapidly.
Similarly, rapid onset of the expression of a particular gene can be achieved
by having a relatively high basal level of transcription with high RNA turnover in the absence of stimulation, allowing rapid onset of translation
from preexisting RNA following stimulation. Hence as with alternative
RNA processing, cases where RNA stability is regulated represent an

adaptation to the requirements of a particular situation and do not affect
the conclusion that regulation of gene expression occurs primarily at the
level of transcription.

7.6 REGULATION OF TRANSLATION

Whole genome methods can be used to study
translational control
As discussed in Section 7.1, it is now possible to use the CLIP method to
identify all the RNA sequences which are bound by a particular RNA-binding
protein (see Methods Box 7.1). Clearly this method can be used to study
regulatory proteins involved in different post-transcriptional processes
including translation as well as RNA splicing or RNA degradation.
In the case of translation however, an alternative whole genome method,
known as ribosome profiling, is available which can characterize the
region(s) in different RNAs to which the ribosome has bound under specific
conditions. Rather than using immunoprecipitation to isolate RNA target
sequences for a particular protein, ribosome profiling uses the large size of
the ribosome to isolate ribosome-bound RNA by sucrose gradient centrifugation (see Methods Box 7.2 and Figure 7.45).
This method therefore allows an analysis of the RNA sequences to
which ribosomes are bound under particular conditions in intact cells. By
using this method to examine the RNA fragments derived from a particular
gene, it is possible therefore to characterize the profile of the ribosomes

The final stage in the expression of a gene is the translation of its messenger
RNA into protein (see Chapter 6, Section 6.6). In theory therefore, the regulation of gene expression could be achieved by producing all possible mRNA
species in every cell and selecting which were translated into protein in
each individual cell type. However, the evidence that different cell types
have very different cytoplasmic RNA populations (see Chapter 1, Section
1.2) indicates that this extreme model is incorrect. Nonetheless, the regulation of translation such that a particular mRNA is translated into protein in
one situation and not another does occur in some cases.
The most prominent of such cases is that of fertilization. In the unfertilized egg, protein synthesis is slow but upon fertilization of the egg by a
sperm a tremendous increase in the rate of protein synthesis occurs. This
increase does not require the production of new mRNAs after fertilization.
Rather, it is mediated by preexisting maternal RNAs which are present in the
unfertilized egg but are only translated after fertilization.
Although in many species such translational control produces only
quantitative changes in protein synthesis, in others it can affect the nature
as well as the quantity of the proteins being made before and after fertilization. For example, in the clam Spisula solidissima some new proteins appear
after fertilization while others which are synthesized in large amounts
before fertilization are repressed thereafter. However, the RNA populations
present before and after fertilization are identical (Figure 7.44), indicating
that translational control processes are operating. Translational control also
operates in the egg to ensure that mRNAs which are localized to particular
regions of the egg cytoplasm (see Section 7.4) are not translated before their
arrival at the correct region of the cell (see the Introduction to Chapter 9 for
further discussion of gene regulation before and after fertilization).
As well as producing parallel changes in the translation of many RNA
species, translational control processes may also operate on individual
RNAs in a particular cell type. For example, the rate of translation of the
globin RNA in reticulocytes is regulated in response to the availability of
the heme co-factor which is required for the production of hemoglobin.
Similarly, the translation of the RNA encoding the iron-binding protein,
ferritin, is regulated in response to the availability of iron.

Chapter 7: Post-transcriptional Regulation

Translational control can involve either modifications in the
cellular translational apparatus or specific proteins which
recognize sequences in the target RNA
In principle, translational regulation could operate via modifications in the
cellular translational apparatus affecting the efficiency of translation of particular RNAs. Alternatively, it could involve proteins which recognize specific sequences in the RNA itself and which affect its translation. Evidence is
available indicating that both these types of mechanism are used in different
cases and they will therefore be discussed in turn.

Translational control can be produced by modifications in the
cellular translation apparatus
In the absence of heme, a cellular protein kinase in the reticulocyte
becomes active and phosphorylates the protein initiation factor eIF2 (see
Chapter 6, Section 6.6) resulting in its inactivation. Since this factor is
required for the initiation of protein synthesis, translation of the globin RNA
ceases until heme is available. However, the use of such a mechanism in
which total inactivation of the cellular translational apparatus is used to
regulate the translation of a single RNA is possible only in the reticulocyte,
where the globin protein constitutes virtually the only translation product.
In other cell types, where a large number of different RNA species are
expressed, such a mechanism is normally used only where large-scale
repression of many different RNA species occurs. For example, phosphorylation of eIF2 (at the same serine amino acid but produced by a different
kinase to that activated by the absence of heme) also occurs following exposure of cells to stress when the translation of most cellular mRNAs is
repressed (for further discussion of the kinases which phosphorylate eIF2
see Chapter 8, Section 8.6).
The mechanism by which phosphorylation of eIF2 inhibits translation
involves its interaction with another factor, eIF2B. Thus, eIF2 is a GTPbinding protein which, as described in Chapter 6 (Section 6.6), binds to
the 40S subunit of the ribosome and migrates with it down the mRNA until
the AUG start codon is encountered. The eIF2 bound to the 40S subunit is
also bound to GTP. However, when the AUG start codon is reached, the
eIF2–GTP complex is hydrolyzed and eIF2-GDP is released (Figure 7.46a).
This release of eIF2 is an essential step to allow the large ribosomal subunit
to bind and translation to begin.
However, before eIF2 can be recycled to participate once again in the
process of translation, it must be reconverted from the eIF2–GDP form into

The guanine exchange factor eiF2B binds to eiF2-gDP and promotes gDP–gTP exchange leading to the formation of eiF2-gTP. The eiF2B
then dissociates and can bind to further molecules of eiF2-gDP (a). Following phosphorylation of eiF2, it binds much more tightly to eiF2B.
This sequesters the eiF2B and prevents it binding to further molecules of eiF2-gDP and promoting gDP-gTP exchange (b).

the eIF2–GTP form which can bind to the 40S subunit. This is achieved by
the binding to eIF2–GDP of the eIF2B protein. This protein is a guanine
nucleotide exchange factor which catalyzes the exchange of GDP for
GTP, resulting in the regeneration of eIF2-GTP (Figure 7.46a).
When eIF2 is phosphorylated following exposure to heme or stress, it
binds much more tightly to eIF2B. This sequesters eIF2B and prevents it from
binding to other molecules of eIF2–GDP and regenerating eIF2–GTP. This
therefore blocks translation by reducing the amount of available eIF2–GTP
(Figure 7.46b). In addition, it has been shown that eIF2B itself can also be
a target for phosphorylation which inhibits its activity, providing a further
mechanism for regulating protein synthesis via the eIF2/eIF2B pathway.
Interestingly, following exposure to specific stresses, some mRNAs continue to be translated since their protein products are required to mediate
response to the stress. For example, following exposure of cells to elevated
temperature or other stresses, the genes encoding the heat-shock proteins
show enhanced transcription (see Chapter 3, Section 3.5 and Chapter 4,
Section 4.3). Under these conditions, it is evidently necessary to translate the
mRNAs encoding these proteins so that they can produce a protective effect
against the damaging effects of stress. This evidently raises the question as
to how such translation can occur when general translation initiation factors
have been inactivated.
A mechanism by which this is achieved has been elucidated in the case
of the cationic amino acid transporter gene (Cat-1), whose mRNA continues
to be translated following the stress of amino acid starvation in yeast. The
Cat-1 mRNA contains an internal ribosome entry site (IRES) which
allows the ribosome to bind to the mRNA internally and translate it rather
than binding to the 5′ cap as normally occurs (see Chapter 6, Section 6.1).
Such IRES-mediated translation is activated after amino acid starvation,
allowing the Cat-1 protein to carry out its function of mediating enhanced
amino acid uptake (Figure 7.47).

though most protein synthesis is repressed (b).

264

Chapter 7: Post-transcriptional Regulation

The mechanism by which translation via the IRES is induced after amino
acid starvation has been determined. Before amino acid starvation, the
folded structure of the Cat-1 mRNA does not allow the ribosome access to
the IRES. However, following amino acid starvation, a short upstream open
reading frame (ORF) is translated into a small peptide of 48 amino acids
and the ribosome reading through this region has the effect of changing the
structure of the RNA, thereby exposing the IRES (Figure 7.48). Moreover,
unlike cap-dependent translation, the IRES in the Cat-1 mRNA actually
requires phosphorylated eIF2 for its activity and is therefore stimulated by
the phosphorylation of this factor during stresses such as amino acid starvation (Figure 7.48).
IRES sequences are not confined to yeast, and have been found in a
variety of viral and cellular mRNAs, including a number of mammalian
mRNAs. It appears that in many of these mRNAs, as in the Cat-1 case, the
IRES may have a role in allowing the RNA to continue to be translated
when cap-dependent translation is inhibited, for example during mitosis or
following stress.
In contrast to the Cat-1 case however, many of these cases involve the
fact that IRES-dependent translation will have a reduced requirement for
eIF4G, which normally recognizes eIF4E bound to the cap and is therefore
essential for cap-dependent translation (see Chapter 6, Sections 6.1 and
6.6). When cells are exposed to stimuli which induce programmed cell
death (apoptosis), eIF4G is cleaved by caspase proteases, inactivating it. In
turn, this inhibits cap-dependent translation. However, translation of some
proteins involved in apoptosis continues, since they have IRES elements
which allow cap-independent translation (Figure 7.49).
As well as widespread repression of translation, regulation of translation
via initiation factors can also produce translational control of specific
mRNAs by acting in conjunction with sequences within the mRNA itself,
which are often located within the 5′ untranslated region upstream of the
translational start site. This is seen in the case of specific mRNAs whose
translation is activated by treatment of cells with insulin or several growth
factors. In this case, in the absence of insulin or growth factor, the capbinding translational initiation factor eIF4E (see Chapter 6, Section 6.6) is
associated with another protein, eIF4E-binding protein (eIF4Ebp). This association prevents the other initiation factors, eIF4G and eIF4A, from binding
to the RNA and results in a general decrease in translation.
Binding of eIF4G and eIF4A is particularly necessary for the translation
of these insulin-regulated mRNAs, since they have a high degree of secondary structure in their 5′ region which must be unwound by the helicase
activity of eIF4A before translation can begin. Following insulin or growth
factor treatment, eIF4Ebp is phosphorylated, releasing it from eIF4E and
allowing the other factors to bind and unwind the mRNA so that translation
can occur (Figure 7.50).
It is likely that the phosphorylation of eIF4Ebp plays a key role in regulating the translation of a number of different mRNAs in different situations.
For example, it has been shown that mice lacking functional eIF4Ebp show

after stresses such as amino acid starvation.

altered responses to viral infection, indicating a key role for eIF4Ebp in the
immune response (for further discussion of translational regulation by the
eIF4E/eIF4Ebp system see Chapter 8, Section 8.6).
Although most protein synthesis is shut down when eIF4Ebp is bound to
eIF4E, the translation of IRES-containing mRNAs will continue since they
obviously do not require the cap-binding complex. This effect has been
shown to occur in Drosophila for the insulin-like receptor (ILR) whose translation increases in insulin-treated cells, since it contains IRES sequences. As
the cap-dependent translation of most mRNAs is inhibited by the lack of
eIF4Ebp phosphorylation under these conditions, the ribosomes move onto
the ILR mRNA, resulting in its enhanced translation (Figure 7.51).
Interestingly, this process is supplemented at the transcriptional level. In
the presence of insulin, the FOXO transcription factor is dephosphorylated
and this allows it to induce transcription of the ILR gene resulting in more
ILR mRNA. In this case, transcriptional and translational mechanisms are
combined to enhance the production of the ILR protein (Figure 7.52).

been defined. For example, the enhanced translation of the ferritin mRNA
in response to iron is mediated by a sequence in this region which can
fold into a stem-loop structure. The structure of this stem-loop is very
similar to that found in the 3′ untranslated region of the transferrin receptor mRNA whose stability is negatively regulated by the presence of iron
(see Figure 7.41 and Table 7.1). This has led to the suggestion that such
loops may represent functionally equivalent iron-response elements
(IREs) whose opposite effects on gene expression are dependent upon
their position (5′ or 3′) within the RNA molecule. This idea was confirmed
by transferring the transferrin receptor stem-loop to the 5′ end of an unrelated RNA, resulting in the iron-dependent enhancement of its translation.
The identical structure is therefore capable of mediating opposite effects
on RNA stability and translation depending on its position within the RNA
molecule.
Such an apparent paradox can be explained if it is assumed that the
stem-loop structure is an IRE which unfolds in the presence of iron
(Figure 7.53). In the ferritin mRNA where the element is at the 5′ end,
this will allow the binding and movement of the 40S ribosomal subunit
along the mRNA until it reaches the initiation codon and translation
begins. In contrast, in the transferrin receptor mRNA, where this element
is in the 3′ untranslated region, such unfolding renders the RNA susceptible to nuclease degradation at an increased rate. In agreement with this
model, an IRE-binding protein known as aconitase has been identified
which binds to the stem-loop element in both the ferritin and transferrin

normally stabilizes the stem-loop structure.
However, not all cases of translational regulation mediated by sequences
in the 5′ untranslated region operate via such stem-loop structures.
Increased expression of the yeast transcriptional regulatory protein GCN4
in response to amino acid starvation is caused by increased translation of
its RNA. The translational regulation of this molecule is mediated by short
sequences within the 5′ untranslated region of the RNA, upstream of the
start point for translation of the GCN4 protein. As in the case of the upstream
ORF in the Cat-1 mRNA (see above), such sequences are capable of being
translated to produce peptides, although in this case only of two or three
amino acids (Figure 7.54). Unlike the Cat-1 case however, translational
initiation at the second, third or fourth of these upstream sequences in
GCN4 to produce these small peptides means that the ribosome fails to
re-initiate at the translational start point for GCN4 production and the protein is not synthesized.
Following amino acid starvation, the production of these small peptides
is suppressed and production of GCN4 correspondingly increased. Once

When high amino acid levels are present, the
small proteins are made and the production
of gcN4 is therefore suppressed. When
amino acid levels fall, the eiF2 translational
initiation factor is phosphorylated. under
these conditions, following translation of the
first small peptide, the ribosome does not
re-initiate to translate the next three small
oRFs. This favors re-initiation at the start
codon for gcN4 and thereby promotes gcN4
production.

268

Chapter 7: Post-transcriptional Regulation

again, this switch in initiation involves the phosphorylation of the eIF2 factor which is involved in translational regulation in response to heme or
stress (see above). Following amino acid starvation, transfer RNA molecules lacking a bound amino acid accumulate and this activates an enzyme
which phosphorylates eIF2. This decreased activity of eIF2 caused by its
phosphorylation then results in a shift in ribosome positioning on the GCN4
mRNA, which can be detected by ribosome profiling (see above, Methods
Box 7.2 and Figure 7.45). Thus, under these conditions the ribosome does
not re-initiate at three of the upstream sites in the 5′ untranslated region
following translation of the first small ORF. This failure allows increased
initiation at the downstream site leading to enhanced GCN4 production
(Figure 7.54, see also Figure 7.45). (See Chapter 8, Section 8.5 for further
discussion of the kinases which phosphorylate eIF2.)
Interestingly, alternative initiation codons are also found in the genes
encoding two mammalian liver transcription factors C/EBPα and C/EBPβ.
However, in this case the two initiation codons are used to produce two
different forms of each of the proteins. One of these is a long form, containing an N-terminal activation domain which allows it to activate transcription (see Chapter 5, Section 5.2 for discussion of transcriptional
activation domains). In contrast, the shorter form does not have this activation domain and so lacks this ability (Figure 7.55). It can therefore
interfere with the stimulatory activity of the activating form by binding to
DNA via its DNA-binding region and blocking binding of the activator
(see Chapter 5, Section 5.3 for discussion of this mechanism of transcriptional repression). Such alternative translation of the same mRNA parallels the use of alternative splicing to produce different protein products
from the same gene.
Study of the cases of translational control where the mechanisms have
been defined thus makes it clear that although sequences in the 5′ untranslated region of particular mRNAs are frequently involved in the translational
regulation of their expression, the mechanism by which they do so may
differ dramatically in different cases.

Translational control can also be produced by proteins binding
to the 3′ untranslated region of the RNA itself
Although the 5′ untranslated region is an obvious location for sequences
involved in mediating translational control, cases where sequences in the
3′ untranslated region play a role in the regulation of translation have been
reported. For example, sequences in this region are involved in modulating
the efficiency of translation of specific mRNAs which occurs upon fertilization of the egg, as well as in mediating the increased translation of the mRNA
encoding lipoxygenase which occurs during erythroid differentiation.
In the lipoxygenase case, a sequence in the 3′ untranslated region of the
lipoxygenase mRNA directly controls the ability of the 60S ribosomal subunit to bind to the mRNA. Early in erythroid differentiation, the 40S ribosomal
subunit can bind to the mRNA and, as normally occurs, it moves to the AUG
translation initiation codon (see Chapter 6, Section 6.6). However, a silencing complex bound within the 3′ untranslated region prevents binding of the
60S ribosomal subunit (Figure 7.56a). Hence, translation only occurs later
in erythroid differentiation when this block is relieved and the 60S subunit
can bind and initiate translation (Figure 7.56b).
A completely different mechanism involving sequences in the 3′ untranslated region regulating translation is seen in the case of Xenopus oocytes.
In this case, a number of mRNAs are maintained in a nontranslated state in
dormant oocytes which are arrested early in meiosis. When the oocyte is
stimulated to undergo meiosis, the poly(A) tail of these mRNAs is lengthened and the mRNA is translated. Hence, in this case a connection appears
to exist between the extension of the poly(A) tail to its full length and the
onset of translation (see Section 7.2 for general discussion of the regulation
of polyadenylation).
In the case of one of these mRNAs encoding cyclin B, this has been
shown to occur because in the dormant oocytes, the polyadenylation factor

CPSF (see Chapter 6, Section 6.2) is not bound to the AAUAAA sequence
which is involved in polyadenylation. However, another factor, CPEB, is
bound to an adjacent region of the RNA together with a further protein
known as Maskin (Figure 7.57). Maskin in turn appears to interact with the
translation initiation factor eIF4E and prevent binding of eIF4G. Maskin
therefore acts exactly like the eIF4E-binding protein described above, in that
it prevents translation by inhibiting binding of eIF4G.

in dormant oocytes, the cPeB protein is bound near the 3′ end of the mRNA
and recruits the Maskin protein. in turn, Maskin binds to eiF4e bound to
the 5′ cap (blue dot) of the mRNA and thereby blocks binding of eiF4g and
translation. When the oocyte is activated, cPeB is phosphorylated. in turn,
this allows recruitment of the cleavage and polyadenylation specificity
factor (cPsF) polyadenylation factor leading to polyadenylation. This results
in recruitment of the poly(A)-binding protein, PAB1. PAB1 then recruits eiF4g
which binds to eiF4e, displacing Maskin and allowing translation to occur.

270

Chapter 7: Post-transcriptional Regulation

When the oocyte is stimulated to pass through meiosis, CPEB is phosphorylated. This allows it to recruit CPSF to the AAUAAA sequence and
polyadenylation occurs. As described in Chapter 6 (Section 6.6), a
poly(A)-binding protein which binds to the poly(A) tail can also bind eIF4G.
This results in subsequent binding of eIF4G to eIF4E and in Maskin dissociating from eIF4E, allowing translation to begin (Figure 7.57).
A further mechanism involving eIF4E and the 3′ untranslated region of
an mRNA occurs in the case of gene regulation by the Bicoid protein, which
as described in Section 7.4 plays a key role in specifying the anterior structure in Drosophila (see also Chapter 9, Section 9.2). Although the Bicoid
protein is a homeodomain-containing transcription factor (see Chapter 5,
Section 5.1) able to affect the transcription of specific genes, it also acts at
the translational level to repress the transcription of the caudal mRNA.
Thus, although the caudal mRNA is equally distributed throughout the
embryo, the caudal protein is only produced at the posterior end of the
embryo where Bicoid is low or absent (for further discussion of translational
regulation by Bicoid see Chapter 9, Section 9.2).
This is achieved by Bicoid binding to the 3′ untranslated region of the
caudal mRNA. However, rather than directly blocking eIF4G recruitment by
binding to eIF4E, Bicoid recruits an eIF4E-related protein known as 4E-HP,
which binds to the cap and prevents binding of eIF4E. As 4E-HP cannot bind
eIF4G, this prevents translation of the caudal mRNA (Figure 7.58).
Mechanisms involving regulation of translation by eIF4E can therefore
involve a protein (eIF4Ebp) which binds only to eIF4E, or one (Maskin) which
is recruited by an RNA-bound protein (CPEB) and then binds to eIF4E or one
(4E-HP) which binds to the mRNA and prevents eIF4E binding. Similarly,
regulation of translation via sequences located in the 3′ untranslated region
can involve different mechanisms just as occurs for processes involving
sequences near the 5′ end of the mRNA.
In summary therefore, it is clear that cases of translational control can
be mediated by sequences in various parts of the RNA and can involve secondary structure, use of different translation initiation codons, regulation of
ribosome binding or the regulation of polyadenylation.

Translational control frequently occurs when a rapid response
is required but also occurs for the genes encoding some
transcription factors
Many cases of translational control occur in situations where very rapid
responses are required. For example following fertilization, a very rapid activation of cellular growth processes is required. Similarly following heat shock
or other stresses, it is necessary to shut down rapidly the synthesis of most
enzymes and structural proteins and begin to synthesize the protective heatshock proteins. Such regulation can be achieved rapidly by translational
control, supplemented by increased transcription of the genes encoding the
heat-shock proteins. Once again as with other cases of post-transcriptional
regulation, translational control can be viewed as supplementing the regulation of transcription in order to meet the requirements of particular specialized cases. In the case of the heat-shock proteins, this combination of
transcriptional and translational control is further supplemented by an
increased stability of the heat-shock mRNAs and decreased stability of other
mRNAs following exposure to elevated temperature providing a further
means of producing a rapid and effective response (see also Section 7.7).
The case of the yeast GCN4 protein provides a different aspect to translational control, however. This protein is a transcriptional regulator which
increases the transcription of several genes encoding the enzymes of amino
acid biosynthesis in response to a lack of one or more amino acids. In this
case the synthesis of a transcriptional regulatory protein is regulated by translational control. As discussed in Chapter 10 (Section 10.2) a similar mechanism regulates the translation of the mRNA encoding the ATF4 mammalian
transcription factor, indicating that this effect is not confined to yeast cells.

transcriptional regulatory molecules may preexist in an inactive form and be
activated by protein modifications (see Chapter 8), this suggests that it may be
necessary for the cell to control the expression of some of its transcriptional
regulatory molecules at levels other than that of gene transcription.
Translational control is one means by which such regulation is achieved.

7.7

POST-TRANSCRIPTIONAL INhIBITION OF GENE
EXPRESSION BY REGULATORY RNAs

Small RNAs can inhibit gene expression post-transcriptionally
Throughout this chapter, we have discussed cases where particular
sequences in individual RNAs are targeted by specific proteins to produce
alternative splicing, altered polyadenylation, transport, stability or translation or to edit the RNA. As noted in Chapter 1 (Section 1.5) however, it has
become clear that regulation of gene expression can also be achieved by
very small RNA molecules of between 20 and 30 bases in length, which
inhibit the expression of specific genes.
As discussed in Chapter 3 (Section 3.4), such small RNAs can produce their
inhibitory effect at the level of transcription by modulating chromatin structure. However, in the majority of cases defined so far, they achieve their effect
by acting post-transcriptionally either by promoting mRNA degradation or by
blocking translation. These effects will therefore be discussed in this section.
Evidently, mRNA stability and mRNA translation are closely linked. Thus,
degradation of an mRNA will obviously prevent its translation while blocking
the translation of an mRNA can render it unstable resulting in its degradation. There has therefore been some controversy over whether the primary
effect of a small RNA is to induce RNA degradation (thereby also resulting in
a consequent failure of translation) or to block translation directly (thereby
resulting in consequent RNA degradation). It is now clear however, that
both processes are involved, so that in some cases the primary effect of a
small RNA is to induce the degradation of its target, whereas in others the
primary effect is on translation of the mRNA. These effects will therefore be
discussed in turn.
A key parameter affecting whether a particular small RNA will affect
mRNA degradation or translation is its complementarity to its target mRNA.
As discussed in Chapter 1 (Section 1.5), small RNAs achieve their effects by
binding to their target to form a partially double-stranded RNA. If there is a
perfect match between the small RNA and its target then this results in
endonucleolytic cleavage of the mRNA (Figure 7.59).
This effect is predominantly observed in the small interfering RNA
(siRNA) class of small RNAs. These siRNAs are produced by cleavage of a
double-stranded RNA molecule and then target further single-stranded RNA
copies of the same sequence. They therefore normally have perfect complementarity to their target (see Chapter 1, Section 1.5).

some miRNAs and all siRNAs have perfect

However, most miRNAs have only partial

produce either deadenylation of the mRNA
and its subsequent degradation or blockage
of its translation.

272

Chapter 7: Post-transcriptional Regulation

In contrast, the other major class of small RNAs, the microRNAs
(miRNAs), are cleaved from a specific precursor RNA which is a singlestranded molecule that has folded to form a double-stranded structure.
They then hybridize to distinct mRNA targets (see Chapter 1, Section 1.5).
In some cases in mammals and often in plants, these miRNAs have perfect
complementarity to their target mRNAs and will therefore induce endonucleolytic cleavage, as for the siRNAs. In the majority of cases in humans and
other animals however, they will have only partial complementarity to
their target mRNAs. In these situations, they induce either deadenylation of
the mRNA leading to its exonucleolytic cleavage or block its translation
(Figure 7.59). The effects of miRNAs and/or siRNAs on mRNA degradation
or translation will now be discussed in detail.

Small RNAs can induce mRNA degradation
After processing of the precursor siRNA or miRNA to the mature form is
complete (see Chapter 1, Section 1.5), the mature small RNA binds a multiprotein complex, known as the RNA-induced silencing complex (RISC). This
complex contains one or other of the Argonaute family of proteins of which
there are four in mammalian cells and which are RNA-binding proteins
(Figure 7.60). The structure of the human Ago2 protein has recently been
determined and shown to have a multidomain structure (Figure 7.61)
facilitating its interaction with other proteins in the RISC.
Once the RISC has formed, the small RNA in the complex then binds to a
target mRNA. If there is a perfect base pair match between the small RNA and
its target mRNA, as normally occurs with siRNA and in some miRNA cases,

in cases where there is perfect complementarity between a small RNA (sRNA) and its target mRNA, the Argonaute (A) protein in the RNAinduced silencing complex (Risc) will internally cleave the target mRNA. The small RNA will then be released intact while its cleaved target
will be further degraded.

POST-TRANSCRIPTIONAL INHIBITION OF GENE EXPRESSION BY REGULATORY RNAs

273

the Argonaute protein will cleave the mRNA between the two nucleotides
that are base paired with nucleotides 10 and 11 of the small RNA (Figure 7.60).
This will result in the mRNA being cut into two pieces, each of which has
one end that is unprotected either by a 5′ cap or a 3′ poly(A) tail. The initial
endonuclease cut within the RNA is therefore followed by further exonuclease digestion from the free end of each mRNA fragment. Interestingly, the
siRNA or miRNA itself is not cut in this process but remains intact. It can
therefore bind to further copies of its target mRNA and induce their degradation, making the process of gene repression by small RNAs highly efficient.
As noted above, in most cases involving miRNAs, the miRNA will not
have perfect complementarity to its target sequence. Indeed, an individual
miRNA can hybridize to many different mRNAs to which it has significant
but not total homology and thereby repress a number of different genes.
Such cases of non-perfect homology can also result in degradation of
the target mRNA but via a different mechanism to that discussed above.
Although these cases also involve the RISC and hybridization to the target
mRNA, the Argonaute protein in the RISC does not cleave the target mRNA
in the region of homology to the miRNA. Rather, binding of the miRNA to
the mRNA will induce its deadenylation (Figure 7.62). As noted in Chapter 6
(Section 6.7), such deadenylation results in rapid degradation of the mRNA
involving its transport to P-bodies and decapping at the 5′ end. This decapping together with the initial deadenylation renders the mRNA susceptible
to exonuclease attack at both its 5′ and 3′ ends. As before, the miRNA is
released intact, allowing it to bind to a new target mRNA and catalyze
repeated cycles of mRNA degradation (see Section 7.2 for general discussion on the regulation of polyadenylation).
Interestingly, inhibition of polyadenylation can also be achieved by the
third class of small RNAs discussed in Chapter 1 (Section 1.5), namely the
piRNAs. Although these small RNAs appear to primarily be involved in inhibiting the movement of mobile genetic elements (transposons) within the
genome, they have also been shown to regulate cellular gene expression.

Thus, as discussed in Section 7.4, a posterior to anterior gradient of the
nanos mRNA exists in the early Drosophila embryo (Figure 7.35). As well as
being dependent on specific localization of the nanos mRNA, this is also in
part due to piRNAs binding to any nanos mRNA at the anterior end of the egg
and inducing its deadenylation and consequent degradation (Figure 7.63).
Thus, artificially inhibiting piRNA production stabilizes the nanos mRNA and
results in some nanos protein being produced at the anterior as well as the
posterior end of the egg, leading to defects in head development.

in cases where the miRNA is only partially

its subsequent degradation. As in cases
of perfect complementarity, the miRNA is

Small RNAs can repress mRNA translation
Evidently, the small RNA-induced degradation of mRNA produced by internal cleavage or deadenylation will prevent its translation into protein. In
addition however, it is also clear that miRNAs can directly repress the translation of target mRNAs, independent of any effect on mRNA degradation. As
with deadenylation, this occurs when the miRNA is not perfectly complementary to its target mRNA. Such inhibition of translation can occur either
at the level of initiation of protein synthesis by the ribosome (Figure 7.64a),

at the level of translational elongation in which amino acids are joined
together to form the protein (Figure 7.64b) or by preventing the ribosome
re-initiating translation on the same mRNA (Figure 7.64c). These effects
will be discussed in turn.
The inhibition of translational initiation mediated by miRNAs appears to
be particularly strong in situations where the translational apparatus recognizes the 5′ cap of the mRNA compared with those where it utilizes an
internal ribosome entry site (IRES) (see Section 7.6). This has led to the
suggestion that miRNAs can inhibit translational initiation via the 5′ cap on
the mRNA. In agreement with this idea, it has been shown that some members of the Argonaute protein family have homology to the eIF4E translation initiation factor. When such an Argonaute protein is recruited to the
mRNA with the miRNA, it could therefore bind to the cap and prevent eIF4E
from binding, thereby blocking the binding of other translational initiation
factors and the 40S ribosome itself (Figure 7.65).
As described in Chapter 6 (Section 6.6), binding of the 40S subunit of the
ribosome is followed by its migration down the mRNA until it encounters an
appropriate AUG initiation codon. At this point, the 60S ribosomal subunit
binds to the 40S subunit and translation begins. Interestingly, there is evidence that miRNAs can also inhibit this stage of translational initiation.
It has been shown that miRNA/RISC can associate with the translational
initiation factor eIF6, which has a key role in preventing premature association of the large and small ribosomal subunits. Hence, its recruitment to
the mRNA by miRNA/RISC could block binding of the 60S ribosomal subunit and thereby block initiation of translation (Figure 7.66). Such regulation via eIF6 is of particular interest since this factor has recently been
shown to be present at relatively low abundance in the cell and to act as a
rate-limiting factor in determining the rate of translation.
These two mechanisms for inhibiting translational initiation are not
mutually exclusive. Indeed, blocking of eIF4E binding and 60S ribosomal
subunit binding may act together to produce strong repression of capdependent translation. Similarly, blockage of 60S ribosomal subunit binding
may account for the cases in which blockage of IRES-mediated translational
initiation by miRNAs has been shown to occur.
Although inhibition of translational initiation is likely therefore to be a
key event in the miRNA-mediated repression of gene expression, it cannot
be the only mechanism. This is seen in the case of the lin-4 miRNA, which
was the first miRNA to be characterized (see Chapter 1, Section 1.5). When
this miRNA inhibits its target lin-14, the lin-14 mRNA has multiple ribosomes bound to it but Lin-14 protein production is blocked. Thus, in this
and a number of other cases where the same effect occurs, inhibition must
occur after translational initiation. This effect could involve a direct effect
of the RISC on the ability of the ribosome to translate the mRNA and

produce the protein (Figure 7.67a). Alternatively, it could involve a protease enzyme which is recruited by the RISC and then degrades the nascent
protein, as the ribosome produces it (Figure 7.67b).
As well as inhibiting translation initiation and elongation, it appears that
miRNAs can inhibit a new round of translation by a ribosome which has
completed translating an mRNA. Thus, as described in Chapter 6 (Section
6.6 and Figure 6.41) the interaction between the eIF4G protein bound to the
5′ end of mRNA and the poly(A)-binding protein (PABP) bound at its 3′ end
results in the mRNA forming a circular structure (Figure 7.68a). In turn,
this facilitates the re-initiation of translation of the same mRNA by ribosomes which have completed a round of translation.
However, when an miRNA binds to the mRNA, the GW182 protein component of the RISC interacts with PABP and blocks its interaction with eIF4G
(Figure 7.68b). This disrupts the circular configuration of the mRNA and so
inhibits re-initiation of a new round of translation by ribosomes which have
already translated the mRNA.
Multiple mechanisms therefore mediate the effect of miRNAs on translation, acting at the level of translational initiation, elongation or re-initiation.
It is possible that different mechanisms of translational inhibition operate
for different miRNAs or that in some cases they combine together to produce a very strong inhibitory effect on gene expression.
Interestingly, it has been shown that miRNAs can also stimulate translation under some circumstances. Thus, in the case of the miRNA miR-10a, its
effect on translation appears to depend on where it binds to specific mRNAs.
This miRNA binds to the 5′ untranslated region of a number of different
mRNAs, including several which encode ribosomal proteins, and such binding stimulates their translation (Figure 7.69a). In contrast, it binds to the
3′ untranslated region of other mRNAs and such binding inhibits the translation of these mRNAs (Figure 7.69b).

miRNAs regulate gene expression at multiple levels
In this section, we have discussed the effect of miRNAs on posttranscriptional processes, such as mRNA degradation and mRNA translation. These effects, together with the effect in some cases on transcription
(see Chapter 3, Section 3.4) allows miRNAs to play a key role in regulating
gene expression. Indeed, it is likely that approximately 1000 different

miRNAs exist in human cells and each of these is likely to bind to and
repress a number of different target mRNAs.
Although many of these mRNAs will encode structural proteins involved
directly in different cellular processes, it appears that a significant number of
miRNA targets are themselves regulatory proteins, such as transcription factors and regulators of alternative splicing. This reinforces our earlier conclusion (Section 7.6) that the genes encoding transcription factors are often
regulated post-transcriptionally and extends it to alternative splicing factors.
Clearly, these effects allow individual miRNAs to have a very widespread
effect on gene expression. By affecting the expression of transcription factors and alternative splicing factors, they can indirectly affect the expression
of many other genes in addition to those whose expression they can directly
repress. Moreover, by inhibiting the expression of negatively acting regulatory molecules, an miRNA can achieve positive as well as negative effects
on downstream gene expression (Figure 7.70).
An excellent example of this is seen in the case of miR-124, which is
expressed in neuronal cells and directly represses a number of target genes
that are expressed in non-neuronal cells. In addition however, it also
represses the expression of the SCP1 transcription regulatory protein and of
the PTB1 alternative splicing regulator. SCP1 is part of the REST transcriptional repressor complex which inhibits the expression of neuronal genes in
non-neuronal cells. Hence, its repression results in the activation of many
neuron-specific genes. Similarly, PTB1 represses neuron-specific splicing
patterns of its target genes. Therefore repression of PTB1 expression by
miR-124 results in neuron-specific alternative splicing of downstream genes
(Figure 7.71) (for further discussion of the role of miR-124 in the regulation
of gene expression in neuronal cells, see Chapter 10, Section 10.2).
This ability of miRNAs to control the expression of specific regulatory
proteins can be taken one stage further where the regulatory protein actually regulates the production of the miRNA itself. For example, expression
of the SF2 RNA processing factor (see Section 7.1) is repressed by the
miR-7RNA thereby regulating alternative splicing events which are dependent on the concentration of SF2. In turn, SF2 stimulates processing of the
pri-miRNA precursor (see Chapter 1, Section 1.5) to produce the functional
miR-7RNA. Inhibition of SF2 production therefore inhibits miR-7 production, relieving the inhibitory effect on SF2 (Figure 7.72).
This therefore constitutes a negative feedback loop in which each factor
controls production of the other. Indeed, it has been suggested that a key
function of miRNAs may be their involvement in such negative feedback
loops, protecting biological systems from random fluctuations in gene
expression. Thus, if one factor in such a loop is randomly elevated it will

SF2–

The production of mature miRNAs can be regulated
post-transcriptionally as well as at transcription
The SF2 example discussed above indicates that the production of mature
miRNAs is a process which can itself be regulated. Clearly, this is likely to be
of importance, since controlling the production of miRNAs represents an
obvious mechanism for regulating their effects on their target genes.
Such control of miRNA production can occur at either the transcriptional
or post-transcriptional levels. In terms of transcription, the genes encoding
miRNAs are transcribed by RNA polymerase II and their transcription is controlled by specific transcription factors which also regulate the transcription
of protein-coding genes. Hence, the transcription of the genes encoding
miRNAs can be controlled by utilizing the same mechanisms which regulate the production of protein-coding genes (see Chapter 5 for a detailed
discussion of these mechanisms).
In contrast, the production of mature miRNAs from their RNA precursors
involves unique post-transcriptional processing events, namely the cleavage
of the initial pri-miRNA transcript by the Drosha protein to produce the premiRNA which in turn is cleaved by the Dicer protein to produce the mature
miRNA (see Chapter 1, Section 1.5) (Figure 7.73). This processing pathway

is distinct from that involved in the processing of protein-coding RNAs and
therefore represents an excellent, specific target for regulatory processes.
Despite the uniqueness of the miRNA processing pathway, many of the
factors which regulate it are paradoxically also involved in regulating the transcription of processing of protein-coding genes. For example, as discussed in
Chapter 5 (Section 5.1), the estrogen receptor is a transcription factor that can
stimulate the transcription of specific protein-coding genes in response to
estrogen. In addition however, following estrogen treatment, the estrogen
receptor can bind to the protein complex containing the Drosha protein and
inhibit the processing of pri-miRNAs, to produce pre-miRNAs (Figure 7.73).
This effect is enhanced when the Drosha complex also contains the p68 and
p72 RNA unwinding proteins, thereby producing strong estrogen-dependent
inhibition of the subset of miRNAs that require p68 and p72 for the processing
of their pri-miRNA to produce the corresponding pre-miRNA.
Interestingly, the p53 transcription factor (see Chapter 11, Section 11.3)
also interacts with the Drosha/p68/p72 complex. However, p53 stimulates
the activity of this complex rather than inhibiting it (Figure 7.73) so enhancing the processing of p68/p72-dependent miRNAs. Hence, specific transcription factors can stimulate or inhibit the post-transcriptional processing
of miRNAs.
Such effects on the processing of miRNAs have also been demonstrated
for proteins which were originally characterized on the basis that they
affected the splicing of protein-coding RNAs. Thus as noted above, the SF2
splicing regulator can stimulate the processing of pri-miRNA precursors to
the pre-miRNA and the same effect has also been observed for the hnRNPA1
splicing regulator (Figure 7.73) (see Section 7.1 for discussion of the role of
these proteins in alternative splicing). Both SF2 and hnRNPA1 achieve their
effects on RNA splicing and miRNA processing via their ability to bind to the
RNA being processed. In the case of pri-miRNAs, this involves the binding of
SF2 and hnRNPA1 to the hairpin loop of the pri-miRNA (Figure 7.73).
Interestingly, the KSRP splicing protein can bind to the hairpin loops of
both pri-miRNAs and pre-miRNAs and stimulates both stages of miRNA processing (Figure 7.73). In contrast, the binding of the Lin-28 protein to the
hairpin loop of the let-7 pri-miRNA and its pre-miRNA has an inhibitory effect
on both stages in the processing of this miRNA (Figure 7.73). As Lin-28 has
not been reported to be involved in any other biological process, this example
also indicates that regulatory effects on the processing of miRNAs can involve
proteins whose effect is specific to those processes as well as those that can
also regulate the transcription or RNA processing of protein-coding genes.

Long noncoding RNAs can interact with small RNAs to regulate
their activity
As well as regulating the transcription and processing of miRNAs, as discussed above, the ability of miRNAs to affect gene expression can also be a
target for regulatory processes. Thus, in addition to small regulatory RNAs, a
wide variety of longer noncoding regulatory RNAs (greater than 200 bases in
length), have been characterized (see Chapter 1, Section 1.5). A number of
these long noncoding RNAs have been shown to bind specific miRNAs. Such
binding prevents the binding of the miRNA to its target mRNA (Figure 7.74).

Hence, the ability of a specific miRNA to inhibit its target mRNA can be modulated by altering the expression of these “decoy” regulatory RNAs which act
as “sponges” competing for binding of the miRNA.
Interestingly, rather than being a conventional linear RNA, a number of
these decoy or sponge RNAs are circular (Figure 7.74). It is likely that
these circular RNAs are initially transcribed as a conventional linear RNA
and are circularized by a “back reaction” in which the splicing machinery
joins together the 5′ and 3′ ends of the linear RNA to produce a circular
molecule.
Although characterized only recently, these circular RNAs appear to
play an important regulatory role. Thus, such RNAs are likely to be highly
resistant to degradation since they do not have the free 5′ and 3′ ends which
are a target for exonuclease enzymes (see Chapter 6, Section 6.7, for discussion of the mechanisms of RNA degradation) and will therefore accumulate in the cell. Moreover, many such RNAs contain multiple binding
sites for miRNAs, rendering them highly effective in their sponge/decoy
role. For example, a 1.5 kb circular RNA found in the mammalian brain has
over 70 binding sites for the miR-7 RNA. Hence, the effect of a specific
miRNA on its target mRNA will be regulated by the relative abundance of
its mRNA compared to sponge/decoy RNAs containing binding sites for
the miRNA.

Long noncoding RNAs can directly regulate gene expression
post-transcriptionally
As described in other sections of this book, long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs)
can modulate gene expression at the level of transcription via, for example,
effects on chromatin structure (see Chapter 3, Section 3.4) and their effects
on promoter and enhancer elements (see Chapter 4, Sections 4.3 and 4.4).
However, the interaction of lncRNAs with miRNAs discussed above indicates
that lncRNAs can also act post-transcriptionally, acting indirectly by regulating the post-transcriptional effects of miRNAs.
It is also possible for lncRNAs to have a direct effect on post-transcriptional
processes. For example, the 2 kb lincRNA-p21 has been shown to bind to
the mRNAs encoding JunB (see Chapter 11, Section 11.2) and β-catenin
and repress the translation of these mRNAs, thereby inhibiting the production of the corresponding cell proliferation proteins (Figure 7.75). This
example therefore reinforces the importance of the lncRNAs in the regulation of cellular processes and the multiple levels at which they act.

CONCLUSIONS
A wide variety of cases exist in which gene expression can be regulated at
levels other than transcription. In some lower organisms, such posttranscriptional regulation may constitute the predominant form of gene
control. In mammals however, it appears to represent an adaptation to particular situations. These include for example, the need to respond rapidly to
the withdrawal of hormonal stimulation or stress by the regulation of RNA
stability or translation. Similarly, post-transcriptional regulation may be the
predominant form of regulation for the proteins which themselves regulate
the transcription or splicing of other genes.
Such post-transcriptional regulation of gene expression frequently
involves small inhibitory RNAs, such as miRNAs. An individual miRNA can

KEY CONCEPTS
inhibit genes for regulatory proteins, as well as those encoding nonregulatory structural proteins. In turn, the consequent effect on the ability
of the regulatory protein to control the transcription or splicing of its target
genes allows an individual miRNA to regulate gene expression, indirectly
as well as directly and positively as well as negatively.
Similarly, lncRNAs (over 200 bases in length) can regulate gene expression
post-transcriptionally as well as transcriptionally. Such post-transcriptional
effects of lncRNAs can occur either via direct targeting of an mRNA or indirectly via regulating the effects of miRNAs on their mRNA targets.
As well as these post-transcriptional effects on the level of gene
expression, whole genome studies using both gene arrays (see Chapter 1,
Section 1.2) and the very large amount of DNA sequence data which are
now available, have confirmed early studies on individual genes and
shown the importance of post-transcriptional processes, such as alternative splicing or RNA editing in generating multiple related proteins from
one gene. Thus, over 90% of human genes with multiple exons are subject
to alternative splicing, while multiple new targets for RNA editing have
been identified in this way.
Interestingly, as we have seen throughout this chapter, transcriptional
regulation can interact with post-transcriptional regulation, with alterations
in transcription patterns leading to changes in alternative splicing (Section
7.1, Figures 7.14 and 7.15), RNA localization (Section 7.4, Figure 7.39) and
RNA degradation (Section 7.5, Figure 7.43).
Overall therefore, post-transcriptional processes play quantitative and
qualitative roles in the regulation of gene expression, interacting with and
acting as a significant supplement to transcriptional regulation, either where
a rapid response is required or where multiple related proteins are produced
from a single gene.

KEY CONCEPTS
•

Although transcriptional control is the predominant means of
regulating gene expression, post-transcriptional control
processes also occur often as a significant supplement to
transcriptional control.

•

Such post-transcriptional control can occur at a number of
different points between initial transcription and protein synthesis.

•

Alternative splicing and RNA editing are post-transcriptional
processes which are often used as a supplement to
transcriptional control to produce distinct but related proteins
from a single gene.

•

Regulation of polyadenylation can be used to regulate the level of
protein production or to produce distinct but related proteins from
a single gene.

•

Regulation of RNA stability or of translation are often used as
supplements to transcriptional control in situations where a rapid
change in protein levels is required.

•

Small RNAs play a key role in the post-transcriptional regulation of
gene expression by inducing degradation of their target mRNAs or
inhibiting their translation.

•

Longer regulatory RNAs can also regulate gene expression posttranscriptionally, either acting directly on the target mRNA or
indirectly by regulating the effects of miRNAs on their target mRNAs.

•

Post-transcriptional regulation frequently occurs for the genes
encoding transcription factors, ensuring that the proteins which
regulate transcription are not themselves regulated at the
transcriptional level.

Gene Control and Cellular
Signaling Pathways
INTRODUCTION
Transcription factors can be regulated by controlling their
synthesis or by controlling their activity
As described in Chapter 5, transcription factors are essential for the process
of transcription, binding to specific DNA sequences and then acting to either
activate or repress transcription of the target gene. Clearly, such transcription factors play a central role in regulating gene transcription. As described
in Chapter 1 (Section 1.4), transcription is the key stage at which gene
expression is regulated to produce different cell types and tissues or to allow
cells to respond to specific stimuli.
In order to achieve this however, it is necessary for transcription factors themselves to be differentially active in different cell types or to have
their activity modulated by specific stimuli. This allows them in turn to
switch their target genes on or off in the appropriate cell types or in
response to a specific signal, so producing the appropriate alterations in
cellular phenotype.
In general, such regulation of transcription factors themselves can be
achieved in two ways (Figure 8.1) both of which are actually used in different cases. In the first method (Figure 8.1a), gene control is mediated by a
transcription factor being synthesized only in certain tissues or cell types. In
the tissue or cell type where it is present, the factor activates the gene
whereas in its absence no activation occurs.
This mechanism is widely used in situations where it is necessary to
maintain a particular pattern of gene expression over a considerable period
of time and this can most readily be achieved by synthesizing and maintaining the expression of a particular transcription factor over that period. This
method is therefore frequently used for transcription factors that control cell
type-specific or developmentally regulated genes. Thus, the gene encoding
the transcription factor will be transcribed only in a specific cell type or at a
specific stage of development, resulting in cell type-specific or developmentally regulated synthesis of the transcription factor itself. This method will
be discussed extensively in Chapters 9 and 10, as part of our discussion of
developmental and cell type-specific gene control.
Although such regulation of transcription factor synthesis by controlling
the transcription of its corresponding gene represents a simple means of
controlling target gene expression, it cannot be the only mechanism used
to regulate transcription factors. The regulation of the gene encoding a
transcription factor at the level of transcription will require at least one
other transcription factor to regulate the gene encoding the first transcription factor. In turn, if the second transcription factor is regulated at the
level of its own transcription, then a further factor will be required and so
on (Figure 8.2). Hence, the exclusive use of transcriptional regulation

284

Chapter 8: Gene Control and Cellular Signaling Pathways

would require a potentially endless hierarchy of transcription factor genes,
each requiring another transcription factor to regulate its transcription.
One solution to this problem would be to regulate the expression of the
transcription factor gene at a post-transcriptional level. This is indeed
observed in some cases such as the yeast transcription factor GCN4, whose
synthesis is regulated at the level of mRNA translation in response to amino
acid availability (see Chapter 7, Section 7.6).
However, as well as regulating transcription factor synthesis at transcriptional or post-transcriptional levels, it is also possible for transcription
factors to be regulated at the level of their activity (Figure 8.1b). In this
mechanism, the transcription factor preexists in an inactive form in situations where its target genes are not being expressed. It can then be activated
post-translationally in a particular situation in order to activate its target
genes. Hence, in these cases the transcription factor is not regulated at the
level of its synthesis but by controlling the activity of preexisting transcription factor protein.
An example of this is provided by the heat-shock factor (HSF) which, as
described in Chapter 4 (Section 4.3), binds to the heat-shock element (HSE)
in the DNA of stress-inducible genes and plays a key role in their induction
in response to elevated temperature or other stresses.
Interestingly, HSF is present in cells before exposure to heat shock and
can activate the heat-shock genes following exposure to elevated temperature or other stresses, even in the presence of protein synthesis inhibitors preventing its de novo synthesis. It is clear therefore, that upon heat
shock, the previously inactive HSF is activated to an active form by a
post-translational modification involving an alteration of the preexisting
protein. In agreement with this, such activation can be produced in an
isolated cell-free nuclear extract exposed to elevated temperature under
conditions when no new protein synthesis could occur. The mechanism
of this effect is discussed further in Section 8.1 of this chapter. Clearly
therefore, the post-translational activation of transcription factors represents an important mechanism in gene regulation (Figure 8.1b).
Both the regulation of transcription factor synthesis and the regulation of
transcription factor activity are therefore used in different situations. In particular, the activation of a preexisting transcription factor offers the opportunity for a much more rapid response than a process which requires the
de novo synthesis of the factor via gene transcription, RNA processing,
translation, etc. (Figure 8.3). It is therefore frequently used in the response
of cells to cellular signaling pathways, where in contrast to cell type-specific
or developmentally regulated gene expression, a rapid change in cellular
gene expression in response to the signal is required. Thus, exposure of a
cell to a specific signal will result in a change in transcription factor activity
which in turn will produce changes in the expression of the target genes for
the transcription factor. The altered levels of the proteins encoded by these
target genes will then produce the appropriate change in cellular characteristics in response to the signal, so as to allow the signal to have a biological

INTRODUCTION
effect (Figure 8.4). The mechanisms by which cellular signaling pathways
regulate transcription factor activity are considered in this chapter.

Multiple mechanisms regulate transcription factor activity
As indicated in Figure 8.5, a number of different mechanisms allow the regulation of transcription factor activity. In the case of signaling molecules
that can enter the cell, direct binding of the ligand to the transcription factor is a frequently used mechanism for transcription factor activation. The
regulation of transcription factors by such intracellular ligands is therefore
discussed in Section 8.1 (Figure 8.5a). Conversely, signaling molecules
that bind to cell surface receptors and cannot enter the cell frequently act by
inducing enzymes that can post-translationally modify proteins, for example, by phosphorylation (Figure 8.5b). The post-translational modification
of transcription factors by phosphorylation is therefore discussed in Section
8.2 and other post-translational modifications that regulate transcription
factor activity are discussed in Section 8.3.
In contrast to such post-translational modification of transcription factors, other signaling molecules which bind to cell surface receptors act by
inducing the cleavage of a large inactive precursor to produce an active
transcription factor molecule (Figure 8.5c) and this is discussed in
Section 8.4. As we shall discuss, many such cases of activation by ligand
binding, post-translational modification or precursor cleavage also
involve a change in the interaction of the resulting protein with other
proteins (Figure 8.5d) and this will be discussed as appropriate cases are
considered in Sections 8.1–8.4.
It is important to note however, that in addition to affecting transcription factors, signaling pathways can also regulate both the histone modifications (which as discussed in Chapters 2 (Section 2.3) and 3 (Section 3.3)
play a key role in the regulation of chromatin structure) and the posttranscriptional processes (which, as described in Chapters 6 and 7, play an
important role in gene control). The effect of signaling pathways at these
stages of gene expression will therefore be discussed respectively in
Sections 8.5 and 8.6.

Transcription factors can be activated by direct binding of
ligands which enter the cell
In the case of a signaling molecule which enters the cell, it can potentially
bind to a transcription factor and directly regulate its activity, for example, by inducing a conformational change in the transcription factor
(Figure 8.5a).
An example of such a protein–ligand interaction which activates a transcription factor is the yeast ACE1 factor, which mediates the induction of the
metallothionein gene in response to copper. This transcription factor has
been shown to undergo a major conformational change upon binding of
copper. This conformational change allows it to bind to DNA-binding sites
in the regulatory region of the metallothionein gene and induce transcription. Hence, the activity of this transcription factor is directly modulated by
copper, allowing it to activate gene expression in response to the metal
(Figure 8.6).
An interesting variant of this direct regulation of transcription factor
activity by a specific stimulus is seen in the yeast Yap1 factor, which is active
under conditions of high oxygen and regulates the expression of antioxidant
genes. This factor contains disulfide bonds between cysteine amino acids
which create a structure for the protein that masks its nuclear export signal
and it is therefore retained in the nucleus where it can regulate its target
genes. Under conditions of low oxygen, the disulfide bonds are reduced,
leading to them breaking, and the protein refolds so that the nuclear export
signal is exposed. This results in export of Yap1 to the cytoplasm where it
can no longer regulate transcription (Figure 8.7).

Members of the nuclear receptor family of transcription factors
are activated by binding of the appropriate ligand
As the examples above indicate, direct regulation of transcription factor
activity by an inducing stimulus is widely used in yeast cells which are in
close contact with their environment. However, it also occurs in multicellular organisms where the best characterized example is the nuclear receptor
family of transcription factors (see Chapter 5, Section 5.1) (Figure 5.57),
which includes the receptors for steroid hormones and thyroid hormone.
A simple example of direct regulation by ligand is seen in the thyroid
hormone receptor member of the nuclear receptor family. As discussed in
Chapter 5 (Section 5.3), this receptor binds to DNA in the absence of thyroid
hormone and by recruiting co-repressor molecules represses transcription.
Upon binding of hormone however, the DNA-bound transcription factor
undergoes a conformational change which allows it to bind co-activator
rather than co-repressor molecules and therefore activate transcription of

under conditions of high oxygen, the yap1
protein contains disulfide bonds which mask

REGULATION OF TRANSCRIPTION FACTOR ACTIVITY BY LIGANDS WHICH ENTER THE CELL
its target genes. This allows thyroid hormone to produce its biological effect
of enhancing cellular metabolism by regulating specific target genes. This
case is similar to that of ACE1 in terms of direct binding of the ligand to the
transcription factor. It differs however, in that thyroid hormone produces a
conformational change in the DNA-bound receptor, which contrasts with
the ability of copper to produce a conformational change in ACE1 that
allows it to bind to DNA. (Compare Figure 8.6 and Figure 5.57.)
In contrast to the situation with the thyroid hormone receptor, several
other members of the nuclear receptor family do not bind to DNA in the
absence of the appropriate hormone. The glucocorticoid receptor for example, is normally located in the cytoplasm and only binds to DNA and activates transcription when the hormone is added. Originally it was thought
that, as with ACE1, binding of hormone to the receptor activated its ability
to bind to DNA and switch on transcription of hormone-responsive genes.
However, it has been shown that, although the receptor binds to DNA only
in the presence of glucocorticoid hormone in the cell, in the test tube it will
bind to DNA even when no hormone is present.
This suggested that in the cell, the receptor is prevented from binding to
DNA by its association with another protein and that the hormone acts to
release it from this association and allow it to fulfil its inherit ability to bind
to DNA. In agreement with this idea, the glucocorticoid receptor has been
shown to be associated in the cytoplasm with a 90,000 molecular weight
heat-inducible protein (HSP90). Upon steroid binding, the receptor dissociates from HSP90 and forms a receptor dimer. The loss of HSP90 exposes the
nuclear localization signal of the receptor, allowing it to interact with
nuclear import proteins. This promotes its movement to the nucleus where
it regulates gene transcription (Figure 8.8).
Formation of a complex with HSP90 is not unique to the glucocorticoid
receptor and has also been reported for other steroid receptors, such as the
estrogen receptor and the progesterone receptor. Hence, transcription
activated by these hormone receptors involves an interaction with the
ligand which disrupts a protein–protein interaction that otherwise inhibits
the inherent DNA-binding ability of the receptor by anchoring it in the
cytoplasm.
Although the hormone-induced dissociation of HSP90 from the receptors
is sufficient for their binding to DNA, it is not sufficient for transcriptional
activation. Thus, such transcriptional activation requires a ligand-induced
structural change in the receptor which exposes its C-terminal transcription
activation domain (see Chapter 5, Section 5.2) allowing the receptor to activate transcription in a hormone-dependent manner.
Structural analysis of the receptors has shown that the hormone induces
a conformational change in the receptor which results in the re-alignment
of the ligand-binding domain so that it forms a lid over the bound ligand. As
well as preventing the ligand from dissociating from the receptor, this configuration allows the activation domain of the receptor to interact with transcriptional co-activator molecules (see Chapter 5, Section 5.2), thereby
allowing transcriptional activation to occur (Figure 8.9).
Interestingly, although estrogen itself is able to induce this change in the
estrogen receptor, so activating transcription, the estrogen antagonist
raloxifene does not do so although it binds to the receptor. This provides
further evidence for the key role of this ligand-induced structural change in
transcriptional activation. Moreover, it also explains the ability of raloxifene
to antagonize activation of gene expression by estrogen, since it competes
with estrogen for binding to the receptor but cannot activate transcription.

FIgURe 8.8
Binding of glucocorticoid to the glucocorticoid receptor results
in its dissociation from HSP90 and movement of the hormone–
receptor complex to the nucleus where it activates the
transcription of glucocorticoid-responsive genes.

Steroid receptors such as the glucocorticoid and estrogen receptors are
therefore activated in a two-stage process involving first, unmasking of their
DNA binding ability by dissociation from HSP90 and second, a change in
their transcriptional activation ability (Figure 8.10a). This combines the
mechanisms of ligand-induced conformational change and dissociation
from an inhibitory protein, which are illustrated, respectively, in Figure 8.5a
and Figure 8.5d.
Comparison of this two-stage activation with the activation of the thyroid hormone receptor (see above and Chapter 5, Section 5.3), indicates
that the thyroid hormone receptor uses only the second of these two stages
in which a conformational change is induced by the hormone and this
allows the activation domain of the receptor to bind co-activator molecules
(Figure 8.10b).
Hence, in all nuclear receptors, activation by ligand involves structural
changes in the C-terminal activation domain which allows it to bind coactivators. However, in the case of receptors for steroids such as glucocorticoid and estrogen, this is preceded by an earlier step involving disruption
of the HSP90/receptor interaction.
In all the nuclear receptors a critical role in transcription activation
is played by co-activators which are recruited by the receptor in a
hormone-dependent manner. A number of co-activators which are able to
interact with nuclear receptors have been defined and include TIF1, TIF2,
SRC-1, SRC-3, and CREB-binding protein (CBP). As discussed in Chapter 5

289

REGULATION OF TRANSCRIPTION FACTOR ACTIVITY BY LIGANDS WHICH ENTER THE CELL
(Section 5.2), co-activators can activate transcription both by interacting
with the basal transcriptional complex to stimulate its activity and by altering chromatin structure to allow transcriptional activation to occur. Indeed,
it is clear that many co-activators exist as part of multiprotein complexes
with the complex containing factors such as ATP-dependent chromatin
remodeling proteins and histone-modifying enzymes (such as histone acetyltransferases and histone methyltransferases) which together can produce
an open chromatin structure compatible with transcription (see Chapter 3).

Following ligand-mediated activation, the glucocorticoid receptor
can repress as well as activate gene transcription
Interestingly, the glucocorticoid receptor can also have a negative as well as
a positive effect on transcription. Unlike the thyroid hormone receptor however, inhibition of gene transcription by the glucocorticoid receptor requires
binding of glucocorticoid. Hence, glucocorticoid hormone, acting via the
glucocorticoid receptor, can produce both negative and positive effects on
the transcription of different genes.
The glucocorticoid receptor has been shown to repress transcription by
four different mechanisms. In the first of these, the hormone receptor complex binds to a target DNA sequence in the target gene. However, this target
sequence (known as the nGRE) is distinct from (although related to) the
glucocorticoid response element (GRE) which is present in genes that are
activated by binding of the glucocorticoid receptor. In the case of the POMC
gene, the presence of an nGRE results in the receptor binding as a trimer of
three receptor molecules rather than the dimeric form which binds to the
standard GRE (see Chapter 5, Section 5.1).
Unlike the glucocorticoid receptor dimer, the trimer form of the receptor
is unable to activate transcription itself and appears to repress transcription
by preventing the binding of positively acting transcription factors to adjacent or overlapping sites in the gene regulatory region (Figure 8.11). For
example, in the human glycoprotein hormone α-subunit gene, which contains a negative glucocorticoid response element, the nGRE overlaps the
positively acting cyclic AMP-response element (CRE) and only inhibits gene
expression when the CRE is intact. In this situation therefore, the glucocorticoid receptor acts as an indirect repressor which inhibits transcription by
binding to DNA and preventing the binding of a positively acting transcription factor (see Chapter 5, Section 5.3 and Figure 5.54b).
Interestingly, the gene encoding the TSLP cytokine has been shown to
contain another type of DNA-binding site for the glucocorticoid receptor
which appears to be unrelated to either the GRE or the nGRE. Following
glucocorticoid treatment, the glucocorticoid receptor binds to this novel
element and represses transcription directly rather than indirectly by preventing the binding of an activator protein (Figure 8.12a, i–iii) (see Chapter 5,
Section 5.3 for discussion of direct and indirect mechanisms of transcriptional repression). This example therefore resembles that of the thyroid hormone receptor (Figure 8.12b) in that the glucocorticoid receptor binds to
this binding site in a conformation that has a directly inhibitory effect on
transcription, but differs from the thyroid receptor case in that this effect is
hormone dependent.
In contrast to these methods of transcriptional repression, the third
method of transcriptional repression by the glucocorticoid receptor does not
involve DNA binding. This third mechanism relies on the fact that, as
described in Chapter 5 (Section 5.2) very many different transcriptional activators interact with the CBP co-activator and require it to produce transcriptional activation.
As the cell contains limiting amounts of CBP, this results in different transcription factors competing with one another for the limited amount of CBP.
Thus, like the glucocorticoid receptor, the Fos/Jun complex which was
described in Chapter 5 (Section 5.1; see also Chapter 11, Section 11.2),
requires CBP to produce transcriptional activation. The glucocorticoid
receptor therefore competes with the Fos/Jun complex for the limiting

amounts of CBP in the cell (Figure 8.12a, iv). This results for example, in
hormone-mediated activation of the glucocorticoid receptor producing
repression of the collagenase gene which is dependent upon Fos/Jun for its
activation. This occurs via competition for CBP rather than by binding of the
glucocorticoid receptor to the collagenase gene, which does not contain
positively or negatively acting glucocorticoid response elements. Clearly,
this effect will be a reciprocal one, so that activation of the Fos/Jun pathway, for example by phorbol esters (see Chapter 11, Section 11.2), will result
in repression of glucocorticoid receptor-dependent genes as CBP binds to
Fos/Jun.
The ligand-activated glucocorticoid receptor can therefore repress transcriptional initiation both by binding to DNA and preventing a positively
acting factor from binding and by competing with other positively acting
transcription factors for an essential co-activator. Interestingly, the final
mechanism by which the glucocorticoid receptor can repress transcription
involves the repression of transcriptional elongation. The activated glucocorticoid receptor can prevent the recruitment of the pTEF-b kinase to the
promoter of the interleukin-8 gene. As noted in Chapter 4 (Section 4.2),
such recruitment is required for the phosphorylation of the C-terminal
domain of RNA polymerase II on serine 2, which in turn is necessary for
transcriptional elongation to occur. Hence, by blocking the recruitment of
pTEF-b to the promoter, the activated glucocorticoid receptor represses
transcription of the interleukin-8 gene (Figure 8.12a, v).
Hence, the glucocorticoid receptor illustrates four different mechanisms
of transcriptional repression, involving blocking the binding of a transcriptional activator, direct transcriptional repression, competing with other
activators for a co-activator, and inhibiting transcriptional elongation
(Figure 8.12a) (see Chapter 5, Section 5.3, for further discussion of transcriptional repression mechanisms). As with activation of gene expression
by the receptor, all these inhibitory mechanisms require binding of glucocorticoid to the receptor. This contrasts with the ability of the thyroid

The heat-shock factor is activated by stressful stimuli and

FIgURe 8.13
in nonstressed cells, HSF-1 exists in a non-dnA-binding form associated
with HSP90. in response to stresses such as elevated temperatures,
HSP90 dissociates from HSF-1 and binds to unfolded proteins produced
as a result of the stress. This allows HSF-1 to form a trimer which can
bind to dnA but which needs to be further modified by phosphorylation
(orange dots) before it can activate transcription of the genes encoding
the heat-shock proteins.

The HSP90 protein also plays a critical role in the activation of HSF-1, which
stimulates the transcription of genes induced by heat and other stresses.
Genes inducible in this way include those encoding hsp70 (see Chapter 4,
Section 4.3) and hsp90 itself. As noted above, HSF can be activated in cultured cells or in cellular extracts under conditions when new protein synthesis cannot occur. It must therefore be activated by modification of a
preexisting inactive form.
In fact, before exposure of cells to heat or other stresses, HSF exists as a
monomer associated with HSP90. Under these conditions, the molecule
folds in such a way that its DNA-binding domain is masked and it cannot
therefore bind to DNA. Following exposure to elevated temperature or other
stresses, HSF-1 is converted to a trimer of three HSF-1 molecules that can
bind to DNA. As with the steroid hormone receptors, the activation of HSF-1
involves the dissociation of HSP90 which binds to HSF-1 in unstressed cells
and maintains it in an inactive form that cannot bind to DNA (Figure 8.13).
Interestingly, HSP90, like many of the proteins inducible by heat or other
stresses, functions as a so-called “chaperone” protein, promoting the folding
of unfolded or poorly folded proteins and thereby protecting the cell against
this effect of stressful stimuli. Clearly, heat or other stresses will increase the
amount of such unfolded proteins with HSP90 being “called away” to deal
with them, thereby releasing HSF-1. Hence, this system neatly couples the
effect of the inducing stimulus in producing unfolded proteins with the activation of HSF-1.
In addition to dissociation of HSP90, two other factors are required for
trimerization of HSF-1. One of these is eEF1A, a factor that is normally
involved in the translation of mRNAs into protein (see Chapter 6, Section 6.6).
As heat shock or other stresses shut down most cellular translation, eEF1A
is released from the translational apparatus and can participate in the activation of HSF-1. As well as dissociation of HSP90 and association with
eEF1A, trimerization is also stimulated by an RNA molecule of approximately 600 bases in size, known as HSR1. HSR1 is therefore a long noncoding RNA (lncRNA) which is able to participate in the activation of gene
expression (see Chapter 1, Section 1.5 for discussion of lncRNAs). Hence,
trimerization involves the dissociation of one protein (HSP90) from HSF-1
and the association of another protein (eEF1A) and an lncRNA (HSR1)
(Figure 8.14).
Trimerization of HSF-1 allows it to bind the HSE. However, this is not
sufficient to promote transcriptional activation. For this to occur, HSF-1 must
be phosphorylated on the serine amino acid at position 230 (Figure 8.13).
HSF-1 therefore combines activation mechanisms involving dissociation of
an inhibitory protein (Figure 8.5d) with the activation of a transcription factor by phosphorylation (Figure 8.5b). However, such activation of transcription factors by phosphorylation is predominantly used by factors which bind
to cell surface receptors and then trigger further events inside the cell, culminating in phosphorylation or other modifications of specific transcription
factors. Such signaling pathways are discussed further in the next section.

in response to heat or other stress, HSP90 dissociates from HSF-1. The eeF1A protein
and the noncoding rnA, HSr1, associate with HSP90. This allows HSF-1 to trimerize,
exposing its dnA-binding domain and allowing it to bind to dnA.

Interestingly, lncRNA molecules distinct from that involved in HSF activation are involved in gene activation by the estrogen receptor. Following
binding of estrogen to the estrogen receptor, the hormone–receptor complex not only induces transcription of its target protein-coding genes
(as discussed above) but also induces the transcription of lncRNAs from
the enhancer elements associated with such genes (Figure 8.15). Such
lncRNAs facilitate stronger activation of the target protein-coding gene at
least in part by promoting DNA looping, leading to closer enhancer–
promoter interaction (Figure 8.15) (see Chapter 4, Section 4.4 for discussion
of enhancers and the mechanisms by which they act).

Transcription factors can be phosphorylated
by receptor-associated kinases
Molecules such as the steroid hormones and thyroid hormone can cross the
cell membrane and therefore regulate transcription factors by binding to
them directly within the cell. This mechanism is not possible for signaling
molecules such as the many proteins which act at the cell surface and do
not penetrate the cell. Such extracellular signaling molecules must
therefore act by binding to cell surface receptors which in turn send a signal
into the cell that ultimately results in modification of specific transcription
factors (Figure 8.16).
As will be discussed later in this section, many such intracellular signaling systems involve multiple steps before the modification of the transcription factor itself occurs. However, a much simpler system is used in the case
of the cytokines, a family of small proteins which play a key role in regulating the growth and differentiation of specific cell types and in the response
to viral infection.
These molecules bind to specific receptors which span the cell membrane. Following binding of the cytokine to the extracellular portion of the
receptor, a signal is transmitted to a JAK protein which is associated with the
intracellular region of the receptor (Figure 8.17). This signal activates the
kinase activity of the JAK protein and allows it to phosphorylate members of
the STAT (signal transducers and activators of transcription) family of
transcription factors on specific tyrosine residues. In unstimulated cells, the
STAT factors reside in the cytoplasm. However, following stimulation of the
cell and consequent phosphorylation of the STAT factors, they form STAT–
STAT dimers and migrate to the nucleus, where they can bind to specific
DNA sequences and switch on target gene expression. This signaling pathway involves JAK protein kinases phosphorylating STAT transcription factors
and is therefore known as the JAK-STAT pathway (Figure 8.17). This

REGULATION OF TRANSCRIPTION FACTOR ACTIVITY BY PHOSPHORYLATION
simple mechanism allows the receptor to transmit a signal from an extracellular molecule to a kinase located within the cell, which in turn phosphorylates a specific transcription factor.
A similar mechanism is also used by a different family of receptors
which bind the TGFβ family of proteins, leading to the activation of another
family of transcription factors called Smads. In this case, binding of TGFβ
to its cell surface receptor results in the phosphorylation of one or more
receptor-regulated Smad factors (R-Smads). This then allows the R-Smad
to bind to another member of the Smad family, Smad4, which is a common
binding partner for the different R-Smads and is therefore also referred to
as Co-Smad (Figure 8.18). In the absence of TGFβ receptor-mediated
phosphorylation of R-Smads, both they and Smad4 shuttle independently
between the nucleus and the cytoplasm. Following phosphorylation of
R-Smads, the R-Smad/Smad4 complex enters the nucleus where it can
bind to its target genes and regulate their transcription (Figure 8.18).
Hence, the Smad case is very similar to that of the STATs except that
R-Smad phosphorylation allows protein–protein association with a nonregulated Smad4 protein rather than dimerization of phosphorylated molecules
as in the STAT case.

Transcription factors can be phosphorylated by kinases activated
by specific intracellular second messengers such as cyclic aMp
The cases discussed above are clearly examples involving the activation of
a transcription factor by phosphorylation, as illustrated in Figure 8.5b.
Such modification of transcription factors by phosphorylation is a very
widespread mechanism of controlling transcription factor activity. In many
cases however, the signaling pathway involved is much more complex
than that seen in the activation of STAT or Smad factors. In the case of the

FIgURe 8.19
Binding of specific signal molecules to G protein-coupled cell
surface receptors results in conversion of the associated G protein
(G) from its inactive GdP-bound form to its active GTP-bound form.
in turns, this results in the activation of the adenyl cyclase enzyme
(AC), leading to production of cyclic AMP. Binding of cyclic AMP to
the regulatory (r) subunit of protein kinase A results in the release
of its catalytic subunit (C). The catalytic subunit then moves to the
nucleus and phosphorylates the CreB transcription factor which is
bound to the cyclic AMP response element (Cre) in target genes.

CREB (cyclic AMP response element-binding protein) transcription factor,
transcriptional activation occurs in response to a rise in the intracellular
concentration of cyclic AMP, as implied by the name of the transcription
factor itself.
The cyclic AMP/CREB pathway is initiated by the binding of extracellular
signaling molecules, such as glucagon, serotonin or epinephrine, to specific
receptors on the cell surface. Unlike the STAT or Smad systems, in the case
of the cyclic AMP/CREB pathway such receptors are not associated with
kinase enzymes that directly phosphorylate transcription factors. Rather,
receptors of this type are associated with trimeric proteins which are
known as G proteins because they can bind the nucleotides GDP and
GTP. Activation of these G protein-coupled receptors results in a move
of the associated G protein from the inactive form in which it binds GDP to
the active form in which it binds GTP (Figure 8.19). In turn, the active GTP
form of the G protein activates the enzyme adenylyl cyclase which catalyzes the production of cyclic AMP from ATP (Figure 8.19).
Cyclic AMP is an example of a second messenger molecule which acts
within the cell following activation by an extracellular stimulus. As a small
cyclic nucleotide, it can move more rapidly in the cell than a protein molecule can. Moreover, one single receptor/active G protein can stimulate the
synthesis of large numbers of cyclic AMP molecules, thereby amplifying the
signal effectively compared with the direct phosphorylation of target transcription factors by receptor-associated kinases.
Following its production, cyclic AMP binds to the regulatory subunit of
an enzyme known as protein kinase A and promotes the dissociation of the
regulatory subunit from the catalytic subunit with which it is associated
(Figure 8.19). The free catalytic subunit then enters the nucleus, where it
phosphorylates the CREB transcription factor on serine 133 of the protein.
Interestingly, such phosphorylation does not modulate the DNA-binding
activity of CREB. Indeed, CREB is already bound to its CRE DNA-binding site
before activation. Rather, protein kinase A phosphorylates CREB in a region
known as the phosphorylation box, located between two glutamine-rich
regions which act as transcriptional activation domains (see Chapter 5,
Section 5.2). This phosphorylation results in an enhanced ability of CREB to
activate transcription following phosphorylation.
As described in Chapter 5 (Section 5.2), this effect is dependent upon specific binding of the co-activator CBP (CREB-binding protein), which binds to
CREB when CREB is phosphorylated on serine 133 (Figure 8.20). Once CBP
has bound to CREB, CBP can then activate transcription via association with
components of the basal transcriptional complex and/or by altering the chromatin structure to a more open configuration (see Chapter 5, Section 5.2).
The CREB/CBP example involves the modification of a transcription
factor by phosphorylation (as illustrated in Figure 8.5b) combined with
an altered protein–protein interaction (as illustrated in Figure 8.5d). In this
case however, phosphorylation promotes an association between CREB and
FIgURe 8.20
Phosphorylation of the CreB transcription factor in response to cyclic
AMP stimulates the ability of CreB to bind the CBP co-activator. it
therefore results in the activation of cyclic AMP-inducible genes
containing the cyclic AMP response element to which CreB binds.

REGULATION OF TRANSCRIPTION FACTOR ACTIVITY BY PHOSPHORYLATION
CBP rather than promoting the dissociation of an inhibitory protein, as is
seen for steroid binding to the glucocorticoid receptor and dissociation of
HSP90 (see Section 8.1).
Although the cases discussed so far involve the activation of a transcription factor by phosphorylation, this modification can also reduce the
activation of a transcription factor. For example, kinases activated by
another second messenger, namely an increase in cellular calcium levels,
produce multiple phosphorylations of the Ets-1 transcription factor which
progressively reduce its DNA-binding activity (Figure 8.21).

Transcription factors can be phosphorylated by signaling
cascades consisting of several protein kinases
In the examples described so far, a transcription factor is phosphorylated by
a kinase enzyme that is either directly associated with a cell surface receptor or is activated by second messenger molecules such as cyclic AMP or
calcium.
It is also possible however, for a signal to be transmitted from the cell
surface to a specific transcription factor by a cascade of kinase enzymes.
Each kinase in the cascade phosphorylates the next kinase enzyme and
activates it, allowing it to phosphorylate and activate the next kinase in the
pathway and so on. Ultimately, this results in the final kinase in the pathway
phosphorylating the target transcription factor.
An example of this is the family of receptor tyrosine kinases which
bind a variety of growth factors that regulate the growth and differentiation
of specific cell types. Binding of the growth factor ligand activates the tyrosine activity of the receptor and allows it to phosphorylate itself. In turn, this
allows the receptor to recruit adaptor proteins which bind members of the
Ras family of proteins (Figure 8.22). Like the trimeric G proteins described
above, Ras proteins can bind GDP or GTP, although they differ from trimeric proteins in that they exist as monomers. Binding of the Ras protein to
the adaptor protein promotes its binding of GTP rather than GDP and therefore converts it into an active form (Figure 8.22).
The active Ras–GTP protein then binds to the Raf kinase enzyme (also
known as mitogen-activating protein (MAP) kinase kinase kinase) activating its kinase activity and setting off a kinase cascade. In this cascade, active
Raf phosphorylates the MEK kinase (also known as MAP kinase kinase).
MEK then phosphorylates MAP kinase (mitogen-activated protein kinase)
also known as ERK (extracellular regulated kinase) (Figure 8.22). The
activated MAP kinase then phosphorylates a number of target proteins
including several transcription factors and regulates their activity so allowing target genes to be activated.
One key target for the activated MAP kinase is the transcription factor
TCF (ternary complex factor), a member of the Ets family of transcription
factors (see Chapter 5, Section 5.1). TCF plays a key role in the activation
of the c-fos gene (see Chapter 11, Section 11.2) by growth factors. Active
MAP kinase translocates to the nucleus where it phosphorylates TCF
(Figure 8.23). This is therefore an example of the activation of a transcription by phosphorylation (Figure 8.5b) mediated via a multiple kinase
signaling cascade.
The situation is more complicated however, because activation of MAP
kinase also results in the phosphorylation of another transcription factor,
SRF (serum response factor). Following phosphorylation, two molecules of
SRF and one of TCF form a trimeric complex which binds to the serum
response element (SRE) in the c-fos gene and activates its transcription
(Figure 8.23).
Interestingly, unlike activation of TCF, activation of SRF by MAP kinase is
indirect. Activation of MAP kinase results in the phosphorylation of another
kinase p90RSK in the cytoplasm. The active phosphorylated p90RSK then
translocates to the nucleus where it phosphorylates SRF (Figure 8.23).
Hence, in this case, two different transcription factors are activated either
directly or indirectly by MAP kinase, resulting in their forming a complex
and activating transcription of the c-fos gene.

The MAP kinase system illustrates the activation of a transcription factor
by phosphorylation produced by a cascade of multiple enzymes. Hence,
transcription factors in different systems can be phosphorylated by receptor-associated kinases (Figure 8.24a), by kinases activated by second messengers such as cyclic AMP or calcium (Figure 8.24b) or by multiple kinase
cascades (Figure 8.24c).

TCF

In the cases described so far, cellular signaling processes result in the direct
phosphorylation of a target transcription factor by specific kinases. It is also
possible however, for cellular signaling processes to induce the phosphorylation of an inhibitory protein which is associated with the transcription
­
factor.
This process has been most extensively characterized in the case of the
NFκB transcription factor which is activated following exposure of cells to a
variety of stimuli including inflammatory or stressful stimuli. Such stimuli
can result for example, in the release of inflammatory cytokines such as
tumor necrosis factor α (TNFα) or interleukin-1 (IL-1) which then bind to
their specific cell surface receptors. Similarly, following bacterial infection,
specific bacterial components bind to receptors known as Toll-like receptors. In both cases, NFκB is activated following binding of the ligand to the
appropriate receptor. Activated NFκB then plays a key role in the cellular
response to inflammation or bacterial infection.
Before exposure to activating stimuli, the two subunits of the NFκB transcription factor (p50 and p65) are associated with an inhibitory protein,
known as IκB (Figure 8.25). Such binding masks the nuclear localization
signals on p50 and p65, thereby ensuring that NFκB remains in the
cytoplasm.
Following exposure to activating stimuli and the consequent activation
of the receptors described above, IκB kinases are activated and phosphorylate IκB (Figure 8.25). This phosphorylation makes IκB a target for further
modification by addition of the small protein ubiquitin. As discussed in
Chapter 2 (Section 2.3), the histones are also modified by ubiquitin addition resulting in a change in their activity. In the case of IκB and many
other proteins however, the addition of ubiquitin targets them for degradation by specific proteolytic enzymes. The degradation of ubiquitinated
IκB results in the exposure of the nuclear localization signals on the NFκB
molecule and allows it to move to the nucleus and activate gene transcription (Figure 8.25).
Such activation of NFκB is similar to the dissociation of the glucocorticoid receptor from HSP90 following steroid treatment (see Section 8.1),
although in this case phosphorylation rather than steroid binding dissociates the protein–protein complex. Hence, this activation of NFκB combines
the disruption of a protein–protein interaction (see Figure 8.5d) with the use
of phosphorylation (see Figure 8.5b), although the target for phosphorylation is the inhibitory protein rather than the transcription factor itself, as in
the cases discussed earlier in this section.
Interestingly, a recent study has demonstrated that following activation
by TNFα, NFκB can act to stimulate the rate of transcriptional elongation
(see Chapter 5, Section 5.4 for discussion of transcriptional elongation and

its regulation) as well as potentially stimulating the rate of transcriptional
initiation whereas, for example, the estrogen receptor only enhances transcriptional initiation following activation by estrogen (Figure 8.26).
IκB is not the only regulatory protein which can be phosphorylated by IκB
kinases. For example, the CBP co-activator is also phosphorylated by this
enzyme. As discussed in Chapter 5 (Section 5.2), NFκB is one of a number
of different transcription factors that utilize CBP as a co-activator. Moreover,
as noted in Section 8.1, such pathways can compete for the limited amount
of CBP in the cell. Interestingly, phosphorylation of CBP by IκB kinase
enhances its binding to NFκB while reducing its binding to other transcription factors such as p53. Hence, in this case phosphorylation is used to further augment the activity of the NFκB pathway by making it a more effective
competitor for the limited amounts of CBP in the cell (Figure 8.27).
Moreover, in this case, it is CBP itself that is the target for activation by
phosphorylation rather than the CREB transcription factor. This indicates
that co-activators as well as DNA-binding transcriptional activators can be
targets for modulation by phosphorylation.
The effectiveness of IκB can also be modulated at the level of its synthesis as well as by phosphorylation. For example, treatment with glucocorticoid hormone suppresses NFκB-mediated gene activation by stimulating

Interestingly, the synthesis of one form of IκB, IκBα is actually stimulated
by NFκB which transcriptionally activates the gene encoding IκBα. This
produces a negative feedback loop in which the activation of NFκB is selflimiting since activation of NFκB activates the synthesis of IκBα, which in turn
inhibits NFκB (Figure 8.29). Such feedback pathways are often used in cellular signaling to ensure a strictly controlled response to a particular signal.

(a) A acetylation
Although acetylation of lysine residues was originally characterized as a
mechanism for regulating histone activity (see Chapter 2, Section 2.3 and
Chapter 3, Section 3.3), it has subsequently been shown to play a significant
role in regulating the activity of a variety of different transcription factors.
For example, acetylation occurs in the NFκB/IκB system which was discussed above (Section 8.2). In addition to the phosphorylation of IκB, NFκB
can be acetylated and this acetylation reduces its interaction with IκB.
Activation of NFκB therefore requires both acetylated NFκB and phosphorylated IκB (Figure 8.30).
Acetylation of NFκB is carried out by CBP and the closely related p300
transcriptional co-activators which interact with NFκB (as well as interacting
with other transcriptional activators, see Chapter 5, Section 5.2). Hence, as
well as acetylating histones and opening chromatin structure following
recruitment to the DNA by a specific transcriptional activator, CBP/p300 can
also modify the activity of the transcription factor itself by acetylation
(Figure 8.31).
A similar acetylation of a transcription factor by p300 also occurs for the
p53 anti-oncogene protein (see Chapter 11, Section 11.3) to which CBP and
p300 bind. This acetylation increases the DNA-binding activity of p53, further enhancing its ability to stimulate gene expression.
Interestingly, as noted in Section 8.2 above, the activation of IκB kinases
not only phosphorylates IκB but also results in the phosphorylation of CBP
increasing its affinity for NFκB and decreasing its affinity for p53. Hence, the
activation of IκB kinase stimulates NFκB gene expression in multiple ways.
First, it phosphorylates IκB, promoting its dissociation from NFκB. Second, it
also phosphorylates CBP, enhancing its binding to NFκB. In turn this will not
only result in opening of the chromatin structure of NFκB-dependent genes
but will also further stimulate NFκB activity by its acetylation.

In contrast, the phosphorylation of CBP will reduce its binding to p53.
This will reduce histone acetylation at p53-dependent genes and also reduce
the acetylation of p53 itself, thereby reducing its DNA-binding activity. This
example illustrates therefore how a specific signal acting via a transcription
co-activator can switch gene expression between two different pathways
that both rely on the co-activator (Figure 8.32).

NFκB

(b) Methylation

CBP

As well as being modified by phosphorylation, CBP and p300 can also be
modified by methylation on specific arginine residues. As with phosphorylation, methylation alters the relative affinity of these co-activators for different transcriptional activators. Thus, methylation abolishes the ability of
CBP/p300 to bind to the CREB transcription factor (discussed in Section 8.2)
but has no effect on the ability to bind to the nuclear receptors discussed in
Section 8.1 (Figure 8.33).
Thus, co-activators can be modified by different post-translational
modifications such as phosphorylation and methylation, which modulate
their relative affinities for different transcriptional activators. This has led
to the idea of a co-activator code in which a precise pattern of post-translational modifications of a particular co-activator is induced by a specific
signal. In turn, this controls the activators to which co-activators bind as
well as their relative affinity for each activator and thereby determines the
pattern of gene activation that is produced (Figure 8.34). Such a co-activator code evidently parallels the histone code of post-translational

(Section 3.3) and which plays a key role in the regulation of chromatin
structure (see Section 8.5).

A2

(c) Ubiquitination and SUMOylation
As discussed in Chapter 2 (Section 2.3) and Chapter 3 (Section 3.3), histones
can be modified by the addition of the small 76 amino acid protein ubiquitin
and this modifies their activity, resulting in either opening or closing of the
chromatin structure depending on the histone which is ubiquitinated.
In contrast, in a variety of other proteins including many transcription
factors, the addition of ubiquitin acts as a signal for proteolytic enzymes to
degrade the ubiquitinated factor. An example of this was discussed in
Section 8.2, where phosphorylation of the IκB transcription factor promoted
subsequent ubiquitination, leading to the degradation of IκB and the release
of active NFκB.
Another example of the modification of a transcription factor resulting in
its subsequent ubiquitination and degradation is the hypoxia-inducible
factor, HIF-1, which mediates gene activation in response to low oxygen
levels. Under conditions of high oxygen, the HIF-1α protein is modified
by the addition of a hydroxyl group (OH) to a specific proline amino acid in
the protein. This modification specifically allows HIF-1α to be recognized
by the von Hippel-Lindau (VHL) anti-oncogene protein (see Chapter 11,
Section 11.3). VHL is part of a protein complex which modifies HIF-1α by
ubiquitination leading to its degradation (Figure 8.35). Under conditions of
low oxygen, such hydroxylation does not occur. HIF-1α is therefore stabilized and is free to associate with the HIF-1β protein to form a heterodimer
able to activate transcription (Figure 8.35).
In this case therefore, the novel modification of proline hydroxylation
renders a transcriptional activator a target for ubiquitination and degradation paralleling the similar effect of phosphorylation on IκB. Interestingly,
the oxygen concentration directly regulates proline hydroxylation since the
enzyme prolyl hydroxylase uses oxygen as a substrate to add hydroxyl (OH)
groups to proline residues in its target proteins. As the enzyme has a low
affinity for oxygen, it can only do this when oxygen concentrations are high,
so resulting in the oxygen-regulated hydroxylation of HIF-1α.
The role for ubiquitination in promoting the degradation of transcription
factors, such as HIF-1α parallels its role in achieving this effect in a variety
of other proteins. Interestingly however, in some cases such as the yeast
transcription factor GCN4, it has been shown that ubiquitination and
enhanced degradation can actually stimulate the activation of gene expression by the transcriptional activator. This seemingly paradoxical effect
involves the fact that after one round of transcription, ubiquitination and
degradation remove “spent” GCN4 from the promoter and allow it to be
replaced by a fresh molecule of GCN4 able to more effectively stimulate
transcription (Figure 8.36). Clearly, such a mechanism in which a DNAbound transcription factor is rapidly turned over and potentially replaced by
another molecule of the factor will allow cells to respond rapidly to changes
in the levels of specific signaling molecules which result in changes in the
degree of activation of particular transcription factors and their corresponding co-activators.
In addition to modification by ubiquitination, transcription factors have
also been shown to be modified by addition of the small ubiquitin-related
modifier (SUMO). As both SUMO and ubiquitin modify lysine residues,
they can compete with each other in modifying a specific site on a

modification protects IκB from ubiquitin modification and thereby stabilizes it (Figure 8.37).
Interestingly, both the NCo-R and RIP140 nuclear receptor co-repressors
(see Chapter 5, Section 5.3) are modified by sumoylation and such modification increases their transcriptional repressor activity. Hence as with coactivators, co-repressors are also subject to post-translational modifications
which can modulate their activity. The co-activator post-translational modification code discussed above is therefore paralleled by the existence of a
co-repressor code in which different post-translational modifications of
co-repressors will affect their activity and their relative binding to different
transcriptional repressors.

Transcription factors can be activated by cleavage of a precursor
which contains an inhibitory region
As discussed in Sections 8.2 and 8.3, factors such as HIF-1α and IκB can be
regulated by processes that alter their rate of degradation and thereby control the level of factor that is present (Figure 8.38a). In addition however,
transcription factors can be regulated by processes which regulate the proteolytic cleavage of an inactive precursor molecule to generate an active
transcription factor (Figure 8.38b), as illustrated in Figure 8.5c.
An example of this is seen in the NFκB system. The NFκB-related protein,
p105, is synthesized as an inactive precursor in which the active part of the
molecule is inhibited by an IκB-like region of the same molecule. Following
exposure to an activating stimulus, the IκB-like region is phosphorylated in
the same way as for IκB itself. This results in the cleavage of the precursor
molecule so that the IκB-like region is degraded, releasing the NFκB-like
region which is now able to move to the nucleus and activate gene expression (Figure 8.39).

FIgURe 8.37
Modification of the iκB factor by sumoylation

Transcription factors can be activated by cleavage of a
membrane-bound precursor
As well as involving the removal of an inactivating region as in the p105
system, processing of an inactive precursor can involve releasing it from a
cellular membrane to which it is anchored. In the case of signals that can
enter the cell, the inactive precursor molecule can be anchored to an intracellular (internal) membrane, such as that of the endoplasmic reticulum.
This is seen, for example, in the SREBP proteins which activate gene
expression in response to lowered levels of cholesterol. In the presence of
cholesterol, SREBP exists as an inactive precursor which is anchored in the
membrane of the endoplasmic reticulum in association with a cholesterol-binding protein SCAP (SREBP cleavage-activating protein). When cholesterol levels within the cell fall, SCAP ceases to bind cholesterol and the
SREBP/SCAP complex moves from the endoplasmic reticulum to the Golgi
apparatus where SREBP is proteolytically cleaved to release its N-terminal
domain. This N-terminal domain is a DNA-binding transcription factor
containing a basic helix-loop-helix DNA-binding domain (see Chapter 5,
Section 5.1). Following release of the N-terminal domain, it moves to the
nucleus where it can bind its target genes and activate gene transcription,
thereby producing the appropriate change in cellular phenotype in response
to lowered cholesterol levels (Figure 8.40).

Activation mechanisms in the nFκB family. (a) Before exposure to an
activating signal, the nFκB factor exists as an inactive form complexed
to the distinct iκB inhibitory protein. in response to an activating signal
the iκB factor is phosphorylated (Ph), resulting in the release of free nFκB
which activates transcription. (b) in the p105 protein the nFκB and iκB-like
regions are part of a single large precursor which is inactive. Following
exposure to an activating signal, the iκB-like region is phosphorylated
and the protein is cleaved, releasing the nFκB-like region which is free to
activate transcription.

This system parallels the steroid receptor system discussed in Section
8.1, in which the change in the level of a signaling molecule within the cell
directly triggers activation of its target transcription factor, in this case via
the cholesterol-binding protein SCAP. Similarly, such activation of SREBP
results in a change in its cellular localization, as occurs for the glucocorticoid receptor (see Section 8.1) and the NFκB factor (see Section 8.2).
Proteolytic processing of a membrane-anchored transcription factor
precursor is also used for signals which cannot enter the cell but act by
binding to cell surface receptors. This can involve the cell surface receptor
itself being cleaved to release an active transcription factor. An example of
this is seen in the Notch-Delta system which mediates signaling between
different cells, so that adjacent cells develop different phenotypes from one
another (see Chapter 10, Section 10.2 for discussion of the role of the
Notch/Delta pathway in the development of the nervous system). The
Notch protein is processed from a single polypeptide to form a heterodimeric receptor in which one chain is associated with the cell membrane
and the other chain is associated with the first chain and projects into the
extracellular space (Figure 8.41).
The Notch receptor is activated when it binds a molecule of the Delta
protein which is anchored in the membrane of an adjacent cell. When this
occurs the extracellular chain of the Notch protein associates with the
Delta protein and dissociates from its membrane-anchored heterodimeric
partner. This results in the cleavage of the membrane-bound chain,
releasing its intracellular region. This intracellular region of Notch is a
transcription factor which migrates to the nucleus and associates with the
CSL DNA-binding transcription factor. This converts CSL from a transcriptional repressor to a transcriptional activator and so activates specific
Notch target genes (Figure 8.41). Hence in this case, the active transcription factor is produced by proteolytic cleavage of the receptor itself to
generate an active transcription factor which migrates to the nucleus and
stimulates gene expression.

in the presence of cholesterol (C), the SreBP transcription factor exists in an inactive form in the endoplasmic reticulum, where it is

complex moves to the Golgi apparatus where SreBP is cleaved, releasing its active n-terminal domain (pink). This domain can then move
to the nucleus, bind to dnA and activate its target genes.

mechanism involving cleavage of an intracellular protein is used in the
Hedgehog signaling pathway, which is involved in the regulation of cellular
growth and differentiation. Binding of Hedgehog proteins to their specific
receptors inhibits phosphorylation of the cubitus interruptus (Ci) transcription factor by several different kinase enzymes, including protein kinase A
(see Section 8.2). The inhibition of Ci phosphorylation stabilizes the Ci protein, allowing it to bind to DNA and recruit co-activator proteins thereby
activating specific target genes (Figure 8.42). In contrast in the absence of
Hedgehog receptor activation, the Ci protein is phosphorylated and proteolytically cleaved to produce a small fragment of the protein. This fragment
can still bind to DNA but rather than recruiting co-activator proteins, the
truncated protein recruits co-repressor molecules and thereby represses
gene expression (Figure 8.42).
Proteolytic cleavage can therefore result in the activation of transcription factors such as p105, SERBP, and Notch (as illustrated in Figure 8.5c)
and can also switch a transcription factor from activator to repressor, as
illustrated by the Ci transcription factor. The Ci case is also an example of
an activation mechanism involving modification of protein–protein interaction (as illustrated in Figure 8.5d) since the cleaved form of Ci binds corepressor molecules rather than the co-activator molecules bound by the
full-length protein.

Cleavage of a lipid link can be used to activate a
transcription factor
Interestingly, the activation of a transcription factor by cleavage can also be
achieved by cleaving a lipid link rather than proteolytic cleavage of the transcription factor protein itself. This is seen in the Tubby transcription factor
which binds to phospholipid in the plasma membrane and is therefore
anchored in this position via a protein–lipid interaction rather than a protein–
protein interaction (Figure 8.43). Interestingly, some G protein-coupled
receptors activate a phospholipase enzyme rather than activating the adenylyl cyclase enzyme (as described in Section 8.2). Such a phospholipase
enzyme can cleave the phospholipid which anchors Tubby to the cell membrane, thereby releasing Tubby and allowing it to move to the nucleus and
activate its target genes (Figure 8.43).

SIgNaLINg paThWaYS
Cellular signaling pathways can induce the post-translational
modification of histones
It is clear from the evidence discussed in Sections 8.2 and 8.3 of this chapter
that cellular signaling pathways can alter the activity of DNA-binding transcription factors by inducing their post-translational modification by, for example, phosphorylation, acetylation or methylation. As discussed in Chapter 2
(Section 2.3), the histones are also subject to such post-translational modifications and these modifications in turn affect chromatin structure and thus the
regulation of gene expression (see Chapter 3, Section 3.3). It is not surprising
therefore, that cellular signaling pathways induce alterations in histone modifications in order to regulate chromatin structure and gene expression.
For example, as discussed in Chapter 3 (Section 3.3), the activation of
kinase enzymes by specific growth factors results in the phosphorylation of
histone H3 on the serine at position 10, paralleling the similar serine phosphorylation of DNA-binding transcription factors that occurs in response to
growth factors (see Section 8.2). Interestingly, such phosphorylation in turn
promotes the demethylation of the adjacent lysine 9 of histone H3 as well as
acetylation of histone H4 on lysine 16 (Figure 8.44). The combination of
these modifications produces a more open chromatin structure at specific
target genes, allowing the transcription of these genes to be activated in
response to growth factors.
This example therefore indicates how signaling pathways can produce a
cascade of multiple histone modifications, thereby rewriting the histone
code and altering chromatin structure (see Chapter 3, Section 3.4 for discussion of the histone code and the interactions between different histone
modifications).
As well as targeting the histones themselves, it is also possible for signaling pathways to target the enzymes which modify them. Thus, the
calcium-activated kinases which phosphorylate DNA-binding transcription
factors such as Ets-1 (see Section 8.2), also phosphorylate the histone
deacetylase 4 (HDAC4) enzyme. This enzyme is normally associated with the
MEF2 transcription factor and prevents MEF2 from activating gene expression by producing a tightly packed chromatin structure. Phosphorylation of
HDAC4 results in its dissociation from MEF2 and its export from the nucleus,
resulting in activation of gene expression by MEF2 (Figure 8.45). (For further discussion of MEF2, its regulation and biological roles see Chapter 10,
Sections 10.1 and 10.2).

alter the ability of these enzymes to modify the histones themselves. Effects
of this type have been particularly well characterized in studies of specific
co-factors produced during the processes of intermediary metabolism that
generate cellular energy.
For example, acetyl-coenzyme A (acetyl-CoA) acts as a donor of
acetyl groups during the acetylation of histones by histone acetyltransferases, and increases in its level will therefore stimulate histone acetylation. One of the sources of acetyl-CoA in the cell is the metabolism of
glucose, so providing a link between glucose availability and histone acetylation/chromatin structure (Figure 8.46).
Conversely, NAD+ (nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide) is generated
from NADH (nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide, reduced form) during the
Krebs/citric acid cycle and the NAD+/NADH ratio regulates the activity of
the sirutin family of histone deacetylase enzymes which are activated by
NAD+ and inhibited by NADH (Figure 8.46). As the NAD+/NADH ratio rises
when glucose levels fall, this provides a further link between glucose levels
and histone acetylation.
A similar link between histone modifications and the products of intermediary metabolism exists also in the case of histone methylation. This
involves S-adenosyl methionine (SAM) which is generated during the
metabolism of folate (vitamin B9). SAM is utilized by histone methyltransferases to provide the methyl group that is added to the histones. Hence,
enhanced levels of SAM will stimulate histone methylation, providing a
link between this process and folate metabolism. Interestingly, DNA methylation (see Chapter 3, Section 3.2) is also stimulated by SAM, providing a
link between a second chromatin-modifying process and metabolism
(Figure 8.47).
Signaling pathways can therefore regulate chromatin structure by modulating histone modifications either by directly targeting the histones themselves or by targeting the enzymes which modify them.

As discussed in Chapters 6 and 7, post-transcriptional processes play important roles in the regulation of gene expression. It is not surprising therefore
that in addition to regulating transcription factor activity, cellular signaling
pathways can also regulate post-transcriptional events. Such regulatory
processes are discussed in this section.

The pI3-kinase/akt system plays a key role in regulating gene
expression in response to growth factors or insulin
The binding of a number of growth factors or of the peptide hormone insulin
to their specific cell surface receptors results in the activation of the PI3kinase/Akt system, which plays a key role in the regulation of cellular
growth and in the cellular response to insulin.
Following binding of growth factors or insulin to their specific receptors, phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3-kinase) is activated. This enzyme
then phosphorylates the inositol phospholipid molecule, phosphatidylinositol 4,5-biphosphate (PIP2) at the 3 position of the inositol ring to
produce phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-triphosphate (PIP3) (Figure 8.48).

Binding of ligands, such as insulin or growth factors, to their
specific receptors activates Pi3-kinase which phosphorylates the
inositol lipid PiP2 on the 3 position of the inositol ring, to produce
PiP3. PiP3 activates the PdK1 kinase, which in turn phosphorylates
and activates the Akt kinase. This allows Akt to promote the
phosphorylation of target factors involved in rnA splicing and
mrnA translation, as well as specific transcription factors.

PIP3 functions as a second messenger molecule which in particular activates the kinase PDK1 (3-phosphoinositide-dependent kinase 1). In turn,
PDK1 phosphorylates the Akt kinase (also known as protein kinase B) and
activates it (Figure 8.48).
This signal pathway thus involves a multi-kinase cascade, as in the MAP
kinase system (see Section 8.2) but includes phosphorylation of lipid molecules catalyzed by a lipid kinase as well as protein phosphorylation catalyzed by protein kinases.
The activated Akt kinase can regulate both transcription and posttranscriptional events by phosphorylating specific targets. Thus like the
other kinases described above, Akt can regulate transcription by phosphorylating specific transcription factors. For example, Akt phosphorylates the
FOXO1 transcription factor. Unlike the phosphorylation events discussed in
Section 8.2, phosphorylation of FOXO1 inhibits its ability to activate its target genes by promoting its retention in the cytoplasm (Figure 8.49). Akt
also phosphorylates the PGC-1α protein which is a co-activator for FOXO1
and other transcription factors. Such phosphorylation of PGC-1α by Akt
inhibits the activity of PGC-1α. In this case therefore insulin signaling
induces phosphorylation events which inhibit the activation of specific
genes by targeting both a transcriptional activator (FOXO1) and the coactivator which it requires to activate transcription (PGC-1α) (Figure 8.49).
Similarly, Akt can phosphorylate the EZH2 polycomb factor. In turn,
this reduces the ability of EZH2 to enhance the methylation of histone H3
on lysine 27 and thereby produce a tightly packed chromatin structure
(Figure 8.50). (See Chapter 3, Section 3.3 and Chapter 5, Section 5.1, for
discussion of polycomb proteins and Chapter 11, Section 11.4, for further
discussion of EZH2). Interestingly, Akt also phosphorylates the DNMT1
DNA methyltransferase enzyme (see Chapter 3, Section 3.2) and the ISW1
chromatin-remodeling enzyme (see Chapter 2, Section 2.2), indicating that
it can target multiple processes involved in the regulation of chromatin
structure (Figure 8.50).

Most importantly however, Akt also targets factors involved in posttranscriptional processes and thereby regulates gene expression at
post-transcriptional levels. One example of such regulation involves the
SF2 member of the SR protein family which plays a key role in determining
which 5′ splice site is joined to a specific 3′ splice site (see Chapter 7, Section
7.1). This factor is regulated by multiple phosphorylation events catalyzed
by Akt. Following its synthesis in the cytoplasm, SF2 is phosphorylated
within its SR domain and such phosphorylation is essential for its transport
to the nucleus (Figure 8.51). Subsequently, further phosphorylation of SF2
takes place in the nucleus and enhances the ability of SF2 to recruit the U1
snRNP particle to the 5′ splice site. In turn, this promotes the joining of the
more proximal of two 5′ splice sites to a 3′ splice site (see Chapter 7, Section
7.1). Hence, in this case phosphorylation of SF2 enhances its activity and
allows it to promote specific alternative splicing decisions.
One target for phosphorylated SF2 is the fibronectin RNA where SF2 promotes the inclusion of the alternatively sliced EDA exon in the mRNA by
stimulating the use of a proximal 5′ splice site (Figure 8.52). Interestingly,
it has been shown that SF2 also stimulates the translation of fibronectin

mRNA containing the EDA exon, indicating that it can act at the level of
translation as well as at the level of splicing (Figure 8.52).

Akt

A
As discussed in Chapter 7 (Section 7.7) members of the Argonaute family of
proteins play a key role in the ability of microRNAs (miRNAs) to repress
gene expression, either by promoting degradation of the target mRNA or by
inhibiting its translation. It has recently been demonstrated that the
Argonaute 2 protein can be phosphorylated by Akt. Moreover, such phosphorylation enhances its ability to promote miRNA-mediated inhibition of
mRNA translation but reduces its ability to promote miRNA-mediated mRNA
degradation (Figure 8.53). Hence, Akt-mediated phosphorylation of the
Argonaute 2 protein has opposite effects on different miRNA-mediated
mechanisms of post-transcriptional repression.

A
As well as regulating mRNA translation via miRNAs, Akt can also affect this
process via proteins which are involved in translation. Such regulation of
translation involves Akt activating the target of rapamycin (TOR) kinase,
so-called because it was originally defined as the cellular target for the bacterial toxin rapamycin. This activation of the TOR kinase is achieved by Akt
phosphorylating the inhibitory TSC2 protein. Such phosphorylation relieves
the inhibitory effect of TSC2 on the TOR kinase so resulting in its activation.
Activated TOR has a number of stimulatory effects on the process of
translation. Most importantly, it phosphorylates eIF4E-binding proteins,
which bind to the eIF4E translational initiation factor and prevent it binding to other translation initiation factors (see Chapter 7, Section 7.6). The
interaction between eIF4E-binding proteins and eIF4E is inhibited by
phosphorylation of eIF4E-binding proteins, so allowing eIF4E to bind the
translational initiation factors eIF4G and eIF4A and thereby promoting
translation (Figure 8.54a).
As noted in Chapter 7 (Section 7.6), activation of eIF4E in response to
insulin or growth factors is of particular importance in enhancing the translation of specific mRNAs which have a high degree of secondary structure in
their 5′ untranslated region. Thus, the recruitment of eI4F4A by eIF4E plays
an important role in unwinding this secondary structure and allowing translation of these mRNAs (see Figure 7.50).
In addition, to targeting eIF4E-binding proteins, TOR also stimulates
translation by phosphorylating and activating the S6 kinase (S6K). Before
phosphorylation and activation, S6K is associated with the translational initiation factor eIF3 in an inactive complex. Phosphorylation of S6K results in
its dissociation from eIF3. S6K then phosphorylates the S6 ribosomal protein, increasing its activity, and also phosphorylates the eIF4B translational
initiation factor. In turn, phosphorylated eIF4B now associates with the
released eIF3 to form an active complex (Figure 8.54b).
By activating TOR, the PI3 kinase/Akt pathway therefore plays a key role
in activating translation, both by activating translational initiation and by
stimulating the activity of ribosomal proteins such as S6. This therefore
allows an enhanced rate of translation to occur in response to cellular
growth signals or insulin treatment.

Although changes in the rate of protein synthesis are an important response
to growth signals, sustained growth also requires enhanced synthesis of the
ribosomal RNAs and proteins to allow more ribosomes to be produced. TOR,
in addition to directly regulating translation, also stimulates transcription by
all three RNA polymerases in order to do this.
In the case of RNA polymerase I, activation of TOR results in the phosphorylation of the TIF-IA transcription factor increasing its activity. TIF-IA is
bound to RNA polymerase I and by interacting with the promoter-bound
factor SLI/TIF-IB, plays a key role in recruiting RNA polymerase I to the
ribosomal RNA gene promoters (see Chapter 4, Section 4.1 for discussion of
RNA polymerase I transcription). Hence, activation of TIF-IA results in
enhanced recruitment of RNA polymerase I to the promoter of the ribosomal RNA genes, resulting in enhanced synthesis of the 18S, 28S, and 5.8S
ribosomal RNAs (Figure 8.55a).
In contrast to RNA polymerase I, RNA polymerase II transcribes a wide
range of genes. It is therefore necessary for TOR to specifically induce the
transcription of the genes encoding the ribosomal proteins which are
required together with ribosomal RNAs to produce new ribosomes. To
achieve this, TOR inhibits the activity of the CRF1 factor, which is an essential co-repressor inhibiting the transcription of the ribosomal protein genes
by RNA polymerase II. Active CRF1 enters the nucleus and acts as a corepressor inhibiting the transcription of the ribosomal protein genes.
Inactivation of CRF1 by TOR relieves this repression and activates ribosomal
protein gene transcription (Figure 8.55b).
Finally, TOR also controls the activity of RNA polymerase III which transcribes the genes encoding the tRNAs and the 5S ribosomal RNA. This is
achieved by TOR catalyzing the phosphorylation of the MAF1 transcriptional repressor. This promotes the export of MAF1 from the nucleus. In
turn, this prevents MAF1 from displacing TFIIIB from RNA polymerase III
promoters and thereby acting as a repressor of polymerase III gene transcription. Inactivation of MAF1 by TOR therefore activates RNA polymerase
III transcription (Figure 8.55c).

phosphorylates eiF4B, allowing it to form

phosphorylates the S6 ribosomal protein,
enhancing its activity.

REGULATION OF POST-TRANSCRIPTIONAL PROCESSES BY CELLULAR SIGNALING PATHWAYS
FIgURe 8.55
The Tor pathway can activate the TiF-iA transcription factor, thereby
activating rnA polymerase i-mediated transcription of the ribosomal
genes (a). it can inhibit the CrF1 co-repressor, thereby relieving its
repressive effect on ribosomal protein gene transcription by rnA
polymerase ii and so enhancing their transcription (b). Finally, it can
inhibit the MAF1 repressor, preventing it from inhibiting transcription
of the 5S and trnA genes by rnA polymerase iii, so enhancing their
transcription (c).

Hence, activation of TOR can activate transcription of RNA polymerase I
and RNA polymerase III-dependent genes, as well as of RNA polymerase
II-dependent genes encoding ribosomal proteins. Although these effects of
TOR occur by it independently regulating three different transcription factors, one for each of the three RNA polymerases (Figure 8.55), there is also
evidence that the effects of growth signals on the three RNA polymerases
can be coordinated with one another. For example, as well as repressing
RNA polymerase III-dependent genes by blocking binding of TFIIIB to their
promoters, the MAF1 repressor also binds to the promoter of the gene
encoding the TBP (TATA-binding protein) basal transcription factor. This
prevents binding of the Elk-1 transcriptional activator to the promoter and
so represses TBP gene transcription. As TBP plays a critical role in the
assembly of the basal transcriptional complex for all three RNA polymerases
(see Chapter 4, Section 4.1), this results in repression of transcription by all
three polymerases. Such repression is correspondingly relieved by activation of TOR and consequent inhibition of MAF1 (Figure 8.56).
Activation of the TOR pathway by Akt therefore results in multiple
effects which promote cellular growth by stimulating transcription of ribosomal components by all three RNA polymerases and by stimulating translation via a number of mechanisms including the phosphorylation of
eIF4E-binding proteins. This complements and extends the roles of Akt in
directly phosphorylating factors involved in transcription, chromatin structure, RNA splicing, and miRNA activity (Figure 8.57).
Interestingly, Akt is not the only kinase that can phosphorylate the TSC2
inhibitory protein and thereby activate the TOR kinase. This can also be
achieved, for example, by MAP kinase which is also activated by growth
factors (see Section 8.2) or by the AMP kinase which responds to changes in
cellular energy metabolism. Hence, the TOR kinase can mediate cellular
responses to a variety of biological signals including growth factors, energy
metabolism, and insulin.

A
In contrast to the activation of translation produced by phosphorylation of
eIF4E-binding proteins, phosphorylation of another translational initiation
factor eIF2 is used to inhibit the translation of a wide range of cellular
mRNAs during cellular stress, allowing cells to divert resources to most
effectively respond to the stress itself (see Chapter 7, Section 7.6).
Interestingly, four different eIF2 kinases have been described in human
cells, each being activated in response to different stresses (Figure 8.58).
For example, the heme-regulated kinase (HRK) is activated in reticulocytes
in response to the absence of heme as described in Chapter 7 (Section 7.6).
This inhibits synthesis of globin protein (which is the predominant translation product in reticulocytes), until heme becomes available to form the
hemoglobin molecule (Figure 8.58a).
Similarly the GCN2 eIF2 kinase is activated in the presence of free tRNA
molecules which have no bound amino acid. This occurs under conditions
of low amino acid concentration when it is sensible to cease protein synthesis (Figure 8.58b). Interestingly in yeast, translation of the mRNA
encoding the GCN4 transcription factor is actually stimulated under low
amino acid conditions when translation of most other mRNAs is repressed

all three rnA polymerases, this inhibits
transcription by all the polymerases. These
effects are blocked by Tor, which promotes
phosphorylation of MAF1 and inhibits its
activity.

(see Chapter 7, Section 7.6). Thus under these conditions, translation of
short upstream open reading frames (ORFs) in the GCN4, mRNA is suppressed and translation of the full-length GCN4 protein is correspondingly
enhanced (see Figure 7.54). This allows GCN4 to fulfil its function of activating the expression of specific genes which are required during amino
acid starvation.
The other two human eIF2 kinases, PERK and PKR, are activated in the
presence of unfolded proteins in the endoplasmic reticulum or following
virus infection, respectively (Figure 8.58c and d). Thus, PERK suppresses
protein synthesis under conditions when protein folding is proceeding
incorrectly in the endoplasmic reticulum and it is inappropriate therefore to
synthesize high levels of new proteins. Similarly, PKR suppresses viral
protein synthesis following viral infection, allowing the cell to respond more
effectively to such infection.
The examples discussed in this section have therefore shown that translation can be regulated both by phosphorylating eIF4E-binding proteins to
stimulate translation and by phosphorylating eIF2 to inhibit it. Interestingly,
regulation of these two factors has been shown to operate in tandem during
the response of cells to the stress of hypoxia. During the initial response to
hypoxia, eIF2 is phosphorylated resulting in inhibition of translation. This is
supplemented later during hypoxia by enhanced association of eIF4Ebinding proteins with eIF4E, so providing a further mechanism of translational repression (Figure 8.59).

Individual kinases can produce multi-level regulation
of gene expression
The findings discussed above demonstrate that post-transcriptional as well
as transcriptional processes can be regulated by signaling pathways. Indeed
as discussed above, the PI3-kinase/Akt kinase pathway can target transcription factors, chromatin-modifying factors, splicing factors, and translation factors as well as a factor regulating miRNA activity, to regulate gene
expression at multiple levels and produce a highly effective response to
stimulation with growth factors or insulin.
Interestingly, these effects on different stages of gene expression can be
linked to one another. Thus, as noted above, the SF2 splicing factor is a
target for Akt. In turn, binding of SF2 to an mRNA has been shown to promote recruitment of the TOR kinase, which is also an Akt target. Binding of
TOR to the mRNA will enhance its translation by stimulating phosphorylation of eIF4E-binding proteins, as described above. This example therefore

links a splicing factor with the recruitment of a kinase which regulates
translation (Figure 8.60). Moreover, it provides an explanation for the
enhanced translation of the alternatively spliced fibronectin mRNA produced by SF2 binding (see Figure 8.52).
Although multi-level regulation of gene expression is achieved by Akt targeting multiple regulatory factors, another kinase enzyme regulates transcription, splicing, and translation by targeting a single factor which is
involved in all these processes. The Pak1 kinase is activated by the p21 growth
regulatory protein (see Chapter 11, Section 11.3) and phosphorylates the
PCBP1 protein, altering the effect of PCBP1 on transcription, splicing, and
translation (Figure 8.61).
Thus, phosphorylation of PCBP1 in the cytoplasm results in its dissociation from specific mRNAs, relieving its inhibitory effect on their translation
(Figure 8.61a). In the nucleus, phosphorylated PCBP1 regulates the outcome of specific alternative splicing events (Figure 8.61b). Moreover, it
also binds to the promoter of the gene encoding the translation initiation
factor eIF4E and stimulates its transcription (Figure 8.61c). The resulting
increased levels of eIF4E this produces will enhance translation.
PCBP1 is therefore a multi-level regulator of transcription, splicing, and
translation. Its phosphorylation by Pak1 allows specific cellular signals to
coordinately regulate multiple levels of gene expression.

CONCLUSIONS
In this chapter, we have discussed a wide variety of mechanisms by which
transcription factor activity can be altered in response to specific signaling
pathways so as to produce changes in gene expression and consequently in
cellular characteristics (Figure 8.62). Where a signaling molecule such as
a steroid hormone can enter the cell, it can interact directly with the transcription factor to alter its structure (Figure 8.62a). Similarly, in the case of
cholesterol-regulated gene expression, cholesterol itself can bind to a transcription factor-associated protein and modulate proteolytic processing of a
transcription factor that regulates cholesterol homeostasis.
In contrast, signals which cannot enter the cell need to act indirectly
via cell surface receptors. As in the case of the Notch system, this can
involve a fragment of the receptor being cleaved off and moving into the
nucleus where it acts as a transcription factor (Figure 8.62b). In the
majority of cases however, activation of a cell surface receptor results in a

post-translational modification of the transcription factor such as its phosphorylation, mediated by specific kinases that are either associated with
the receptor or become activated via second messengers such as cyclic
AMP or via a multiple kinase cascade (Figure 8.62c). These effects allow
the signal to produce changes in gene expression and thereby alter the
characteristics of the cell to produce appropriate biological effects.
Activation of specific transcription factors by specific signals can occur
by one or more of the mechanisms illustrated in Figure 8.5. For example,
the activation of steroid receptors by the appropriate hormone combines
the mechanism of ligand-induced conformational change, (illustrated in
Figure 8.5a) with the dissociation of an inhibitory protein (as illustrated in
Figure 8.5d). Similarly, the activation of the CREB factor by cyclic AMP
involves phosphorylation (illustrated in Figure 8.5b), by protein kinase A,
resulting in altered protein–protein interaction (as illustrated in Figure 8.5d),
in this case the enhanced binding of the CBP co-activator to CREB. Such
phosphorylation is also seen in the case of the p105 NFκB-like molecule,
where it is combined with enhanced processing of the p105 precursor
molecule (as illustrated in Figure 8.5c), which results in degradation of
the IκB-like portion of the molecule and the release of the active NFκBlike portion.
Hence, different signaling mechanisms and different activation processes combine to produce the specific activation of individual transcription
factors in a particular situation, thereby appropriately regulating gene
expression and the cellular phenotype in response to the specific signal.
Moreover, in different cases such activation of transcription factors
involves altering different properties of the transcription factor (Figure 8.63).
For example, activation processes can regulate the degradation of the factor
(Figure 8.63a), as in the case of the HIF-1α transcription factor (see Section
8.3). Similarly, in many cases, the activation of the factor involves a change in
its location in the cell, as for example in the case of the glucocorticoid receptor (Section 8.1) or NFκB (Section 8.2) (Figure 8.63b). Moreover, activation
can also involve direct regulation of DNA-binding activity, as in the case of

the ACE1 factor (see Section 8.1) (Figure 8.63c) or regulation of the ability
of a DNA-bound factor to activate transcription, as in the case of the CREB
factor (see Section 8.2) (Figure 8.63d).
Hence, different signaling pathways use different signal transduction
mechanisms to modify transcription factors in different ways and alter their
activities at different levels. This complexity is further increased by the fact
that such signaling pathways can also reduce rather than increase the
activity of specific transcription factors and can target co-activators and
co-repressors or histone-modifying enzymes (see Section 8.5) in addition
to DNA-binding transcription factors.
Similarly as discussed in Section 8.6, signaling pathways also target
post-transcriptional regulatory processes as well as transcription itself.
Indeed, in the Akt/TOR system or in the case of PCBP1, complementary
effects often occur at transcriptional and post-transcriptional levels, ensuring the most effective multi-level response to a particular signal.
Although the mechanisms used to regulate gene expression in
response to specific cellular signals are highly complex, this is necessary
to produce an effective response and one that can be modulated by the
simultaneous activation of other signaling pathways. For example, the
multiple post-translational modifications which occur for co-activators
and co-repressors are likely to result in the integration of different signaling pathways which utilize a specific co-activator or co-repressor. This
will allow the most appropriate pathway(s) to be activated in response to
a signal, with corresponding repression of other competing pathways (see
Section 8.3).
Similarly, where a transcription factor is regulated at two different levels
by two different stimuli, this can be used to produce the most effective
response to the stimuli both individually and when they operate together.
This is seen in the case of the yeast GAL4 transcription factor which is
bound to DNA in the absence of galactose, but does not activate transcription because its activity is inhibited by the GAL80 protein. In the presence of
galactose, GAL80 dissociates and transcription is activated (Figure 8.64).
However in the presence of glucose, GAL4 does not bind to DNA and therefore galactose treatment has no effect (Figure 8.64). Hence, by regulating
GAL4 at the level of DNA binding by glucose and at the level of transcriptional activation by galactose, the system operates so that a galactose stimulus has no effect when glucose is present.
Interestingly, transcriptional regulation by glucose and galactose has
recently been shown to be supplemented in this system by posttranscriptional regulation. Thus, glucose also acts at the level of RNA stability to reduce the stability of galactose-induced mRNAs (see Chapter 7,
Section 7.5 for further discussion of the regulation of mRNA stability). Both
transcriptional and post-transcriptional processes therefore produce the
desired biological effect in which the presence of galactose alone activates
the expression of genes encoding proteins that are necessary for the metabolism of galactose. However, this does not occur in the presence of glucose,
which is preferred to galactose as a metabolic substrate.
In summary, multi-level regulation of gene expression can be combined
with different responses to specific stimuli when present alone or in combination. In this manner, the cell can build up complex regulatory networks
which allow it to respond effectively and appropriately to stimuli both individually and in combination. This will result in an appropriate biological
response being produced in response to specific signals.
Clearly, mechanisms regulating transcription factor activity in response
to specific stimuli must be paralleled by mechanisms that allow the fertilized
egg to develop specific body structures during embryonic development.
Moreover, mechanisms must also exist to allow individual differentiated

Development

INTRODUCTION
One of the central problems of biological sciences is to understand the
manner in which the single-celled fertilized egg (the zygote) develops into
a multicellular organism with a vast range of different cell types, each of
which forms at the appropriate time and place relative to other cells. As will
be discussed in this chapter, the regulation of gene transcription by specific
transcription factors plays a key role in this process. A number of these transcription factors are expressed at specific times and places during embryonic development and play a central role in this process. Such regulation of
transcription factor synthesis contrasts with the regulation of transcription
factor activity that occurs in response to cellular signaling pathways, as discussed in the previous chapter.

Regulation of mRNA translation occurs following fertilization
Interestingly however, as discussed in Chapter 7 (Section 7.6), the regulation of mRNA translation plays an essential role in the very first stage of
embryonic development. The unfertilized egg or oocyte contains a large
number of different mRNAs which have been transcribed from the mother’s
genome during the process of egg formation (oogenesis). However, the
mRNAs are not translated since they are associated with specific proteins in
ribonucleoprotein (RNP) particles. Once the egg is fertilized by a sperm,
however, the mRNAs are released from the RNP particles and are translated
into protein (Figure 9.1).
Hence, the very first stages of embryonic development involve proteins
which are produced from maternal mRNAs and which are regulated by
translational control. This mechanism has the advantage that it allows the

rapid production of new proteins once the egg is activated by a sperm. As
translation of mRNA into protein is the most energetically expensive step of
gene expression, this mechanism avoids wasteful protein production in an
unfertilized oocyte which may never be fertilized by a sperm, while allowing rapid protein production in those oocytes which are fertilized.
Moreover, this mechanism provides a supply of protein to the fertilized
egg without the need for immediate transcription of the embryonic genome,
formed by the fusion of the egg and sperm. Following fertilization, the fertilized egg or zygote must divide rapidly to form two cells, then four cells,
then eight cells, etc. At each stage the embryonic genome must be copied
by DNA polymerase, so that each daughter cell contains a full complement
of DNA. The use of preexisting mRNA to form proteins in the very early
embryo eliminates the need for extensive transcription of the embryonic
genome by RNA polymerase which might interfere with rapid replication of
the DNA by DNA polymerase (Figure 9.2).
Following fertilization and repeated cycles of cell division the singlecelled mammalian zygote forms a ball of 16 cells, known as the morula
(Figure 9.3). The morula develops into the blastocyst or blastula which
consists of an outer layer of cells, surrounding a fluid-filled cavity and an
inner cell mass (ICM) (Figure 9.3). Subsequently, the embryo undergoes
the process of gastrulation to form the gastrula in which the cells are
organized into three distinct germ layers: ectoderm, mesoderm, and
endoderm (Figure 9.4). These three germ layers will ultimately form the
different tissues of the embryo, with the ectoderm forming the skin and
the nervous system, the mesoderm forming the muscle, cartilage and
bone, and the endoderm forming the gut (see Chapter 10, Sections 10.1
and 10.2).

Transcriptional control processes activate the embryonic
genome
Clearly, as embryonic development proceeds in this manner, a switch will
occur so that rather than simply translating preexisting maternal mRNAs,
the embryo will begin to transcribe its own genome. The transition from
maternal to embryonic gene expression involves the direct regulation of

transcription by the activation of positively acting transcription factors
which are required for transcription of the embryo genome. For example, in
the nematode worm it has been shown that the TAF-4 protein which is
normally part of the TFIID complex (see Chapter 5, Section 5.2 for discussion of TAFs) is sequestered in the cytoplasm of the one- and two-cell
embryo by its association with the OMA proteins. As the embryo divides
further, the OMA proteins are phosphorylated. This targets them for degradation, so releasing TAF-4 to join the TFIID complex (Figure 9.5).
Interestingly in the zebrafish embryo, which provides a vertebrate
example of this process, the TBP (TATA-binding protein) component of the
TFIID complex has been shown to be critical for the switching on of transcription from the embryonic genome. Thus, TBP levels increase dramatically at the time that transcription of the embryonic genome begins and its
inactivation prevents the transcription of a number of genes from the
genome of the embryo (Figure 9.6a). Activation of the embryonic genome
can therefore involve either TBP and/or TAF components of TFIID (see
Chapter 4, Section 4.1 and Chapter 5, Section 5.2 for further discussion of
TBP and TAFs).
In addition to the critical role of the general transcription factor, TBP, in
the transcriptional activation of the zygote genome in zebrafish, it has been
shown that these organisms also synthesize several embryo-specific transcription factors, such as Nanog, Oct4, and SoxB1 at the earliest stages of
embryonic development. These factors are themselves synthesized from

preexisting maternal mRNAs and, like TBP, are essential for the transcriptional activation of the embryonic genome (Figure 9.6a).
As well as stimulating the progressive transcription of protein-coding

essential for the activation in the expression of the gene encoding the
microRNA miR-430 in early-stage zebrafish embryos. Thus in these fish,
miR-430 is one of the earliest RNAs transcribed from the embryonic
genome. It then binds to the 3′ untranslated region of a large number of
different maternal mRNAs. This results in their deadenylation and subsequent degradation (Figure 9.6b) (see Chapter 7, Section 7.7 for further
discussion of this mechanism). It is estimated that approximately 40% of
maternally inherited mRNAs are degraded by an miR-430-dependent process in these fish. This process therefore allows maternal RNAs to be progressively degraded once they have fulfilled their function.

The Oct4 and Cdx2 transcription factors regulate the
differentiation of inner cell mass and trophectoderm cells
The combination of the increasing transcription of the embryonic genome
and the progressive degradation of maternal mRNAs results in a progressive
transition from the maternal to the embryo genome as the embryo develops
through the blastula and gastrula stages (Figure 9.7). Clearly, as the embryo
proceeds through these stages it is also necessary for individual cells to
begin to differentiate into different cell types. Thus, the mammalian blastocyst which consists of approximately 64 cells, contains 2 different cell types
(Figure 9.3). These are the trophectoderm (TE) which will form the
extra-embryonic tissues such as the placenta and the ICM which will give
rise to the embryo itself.
Two specific transcription factors play a key role in determining whether
individual cells will develop into ICM or TE cells. At the eight-cell stage, the
cells express both the POU family transcription factor Oct4 (see above for
discussion of the role of this factor in the transition to zygotic gene transcription) and the homeodomain transcription factor Cdx2 (Figure 9.8)
(see Chapter 5, Section 5.1 for discussion of these transcription factor families). Each of these two factors can both activate its own expression and
also repress the expression of the other factor, i.e. Oct4 represses Cdx2
expression and Cdx2 represses Oct4 expression (Figure 9.8).
As embryonic development proceeds, Cdx2 expression begins to predominate in the outer cells and this represses Oct4 expression. Hence, Cdx2 levels
rise further as it induces its own expression and it is relieved from the

REGULATION OF GENE EXPRESSION IN PLURIPOTENT EMBRYONIC STEM CELLS
repressive effect of Oct4 (Figure 9.8). As Cdx2 is necessary for cells to form
TE, the outer cells of the embryo differentiate to form this cell type. Conversely
in the inner cells of the embryo, Oct4 predominates, leading to the repression
of Cdx2 and the formation of the ICM cells which requires Oct4 (Figure 9.8).
Hence, the expression of one or other of these transcription factors by
different cells in the early embryo produces the first differentiation event
which occurs during embryonic development, resulting in the formation of
ICM and TE cells. Moreover, the positive autoregulation of the expression of
each factor and their ability to mutually inhibit each other’s synthesis, progressively amplifies any initial small difference in the levels of each factor
between different cells.
During subsequent embryonic development, the ICM cells are able to
give rise to all the different cell types in the early embryo including derivatives of all three germ layers of the embryo, ectoderm, mesoderm, and
endoderm. They are therefore referred to as being pluripotent. Clearly, the
gene regulatory processes which maintain these cells in a pluripotent form
but also allow them to ultimately give rise to a variety of different cell types
are of considerable interest in terms of the regulation of embryonic development. Fortunately, it has proved possible to isolate cell lines from the ICM
of the early mammalian embryo and these are known as embryonic stem
cells (ES cells). These undifferentiated cells are able to proliferate indefinitely in culture but under certain conditions can also differentiate into different cell types. The study of these cells has greatly aided our understanding of the processes occurring in early embryonic development and is
therefore discussed in Section 9.1.
Clearly, as individual cell types are formed during embryonic development, it is necessary for regulatory processes to ensure that each cell type is
formed at an appropriate time and at an appropriate place relative to other
cell types. The study of the fruit fly Drosophila has greatly aided our understanding of these processes since it is amenable to both molecular and
genetic techniques. The insights into developmental processes obtained in
this organism are therefore discussed in Section 9.2. Subsequently, Section
9.3 discusses how insights obtained in these simpler organisms can be
applied to the study of mammalian development.

As noted above, the first differentiation event in the early mammalian
embryo gives rise to TE cells and to ICM cells. These ICM cells are evidently
of considerable interest since they will give rise to all the cells of the embryo
itself and are therefore pluripotent, being able to give rise to a variety of
differentiated cell types.
Mechanisms must therefore exist in these cells which allow them to
maintain their pluripotency through a number of cell divisions but also
allow them to differentiate into different cell types at the appropriate time.
Our understanding of these processes has been greatly aided by the finding
that when the ICM is disaggregated into individual cells, the resulting cells
can proliferate indefinitely in culture while maintaining their undifferentiated pluripotent nature (Figure 9.9).
The resulting ES cell lines therefore provide a source of much greater
amounts of pluripotent cells than could be obtained from an early embryo.
Moreover, as well as closely resembling the pluripotent cells of the early
embryo in their undifferentiated nature, under suitable conditions ES cells
can also differentiate to produce a wide variety of different cell types. Thus,
if the ES cells are allowed to grow in suspension in the culture medium,
they differentiate to form aggregates of cells known as embryoid bodies
in which the inner cells retain their pluripotent nature while the outer cells
differentiate to form endoderm cells (Figure 9.9).

When the inner cell mass is isolated from a blastocyst and disaggregated,
undifferentiated embryonic stem (ES) cells can be grown indefinitely in
culture on a feeder layer of fibroblast cells. When the undifferentiated ES
cells are grown in suspension culture, they form embryoid bodies in which
an inner layer of undifferentiated cells is surrounded by an outer layer of
endoderm cells. When these embryoid bodies are allowed to attach to
the surface of a culture dish (in the absence of a feeder cell layer) they
differentiate further to form a variety of different cell types.

This is of particular interest since it closely parallels the second differentiation event in mammalian development in which cells on the surface of
the ICM in the embryo differentiate to form a surface layer of endoderm
cells adjacent to the fluid-filled blastocoel cavity (Figure 9.10).
Subsequently, if ES cell-derived embryoid bodies in culture are allowed
to re-attach to the surface of the dish in which they are grown, they can
differentiate further to form a variety of different cell types including neural
cells and epithelial cells (Figure 9.9). ES cell lines therefore offer a highly
convenient source of pluripotent cells which are closely related to those
found in the early embryo and which like early embryonic cells, can differentiate to form a wide variety of different cell types.
Indeed, the close equivalence of ES cell lines with pluripotent cells of the
early embryo can be further demonstrated by injecting ES cells into the blastula stage of an embryo with a different genotype from that of the injected
cells. If this chimeric blastocyst is allowed to develop, it will form a mouse
in which every organ contains contributions both from the original blastocyst and from the injected ES cells. This can be demonstrated, for example,
if the injected cells differ from those of the host blastocyst in the coat color
which they will produce (for example, white versus black). In this case, the
resulting mouse will show a chimeric coat color in which some regions are
of one color showing that they are derived from the injected ES cells, while
other regions are of a different color indicating that they are derived from
the original host blastocyst (Figure 9.11).
Therefore when inserted into an embryo, ES cells can contribute to all
the differentiated cells of the resulting adult animal. Most importantly, it
has been demonstrated that they can also produce functional eggs and
sperm in these animals. Thus, by breeding first-generation chimeric
animals obtained as described above it is possible to produce secondgeneration animals which are entirely derived from the injected ES cells
(Figure 9.11).
This procedure has been extensively used to introduce genetic mutations into mice (knockout mice) by first introducing the mutation into the
ES cell genome and then producing mice which carry the mutation by
injecting the ES cells into a blastocyst embryo. For our purposes however,
the most important finding from these experiments is that ES cells are
indeed pluripotent, since as well as producing differentiated cell types they
can also give rise to egg and sperm cells, allowing the production of an
intact animal entirely derived from the injected ES cells.

Several transcription factors which are expressed specifically
in eS cells can together reprogram differentiated cells to an eS

Embryonic stem (ES) cells injected into the inner cell mass of a blastocyst
can contribute to all cell types in the mouse which forms from the
blastocyst, when it is re-implanted into a foster mother. this can be
visualized if the ES cells are of a different genotype from the recipient
blastocyst, for example, having the genes required to form a “pink”
coat color rather than a “gray” coat color. the injected ES cells can also
contribute to the formation of sperm or egg cells in this experiment.
Hence, breeding of the chimeric mice produced by ES cell injection results
in offspring which are entirely derived from the injected ES cells and in this
case have a “pink” rather than a “gray” coat color.

processes. A number of transcription factors expressed in pluripotent ES
cells have been identified and characterized. The expression of several of
these factors has been shown to be down-regulated as ES cells differentiate, suggesting that they play a key role in undifferentiated ES cells.
Most interestingly, it has been shown that the overexpression of just four
of these transcription factors, Oct4, Sox2, Klf4, and c-Myc in differentiated
fibroblast cells was sufficient to reprogram them to a pluripotent ES cell-like
state (Figure 9.12) (see Introduction for discussion of the role of Oct4 in
the transition to zygotic gene transcription and in ICM differentiation).
Subsequently, this was also achieved with a different but related cocktail of
regulatory factors composed of Oct4, Sox2, Nanog, and Lin-28.
These experiments were primarily carried out to try and provide a source
of undifferentiated human stem cells for therapeutic purposes which would
be more ethically acceptable than using ES cells derived from early human
embryos. Thus, if differentiated cells from human individuals could be
reprogrammed into ES-like cells, then these could be grown in culture and
differentiated to provide large amounts of specific differentiated cells. Such
cells could then be transplanted into patients suffering from degenerative
diseases caused by a loss of a particular cell type. Thus, for example, differentiated neuronal cells produced in this way could in the future be used to
treat neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer’s and Parkinson’s diseases, while cardiac cells could be used to replace heart cells lost during a
heart attack. Similarly, if such cells are obtained from patients with specific
neurological diseases, they could be used to provide a convenient source of
cultured neuronal cells for research purposes aimed at improving our understanding of these diseases and their potential treatment.
Interestingly, the production of human ES cells can also be achieved by
using the nuclear transfer procedures used in Amphibia and mice to produce cloned animals (see Chapter 1, Section 1.3, and Figure 1.16). Thus, if
the nucleus is removed from a human oocyte and replaced with the nucleus
from a human differentiated cell, it is possible to produce blastocyst stage
embryos. In turn, the ICM cells can be removed from these embryos and
used to produce undifferentiated ES cell lines which can then be differentiated to produce different cell types.
Hence, human differentiated cells capable of being used in therapeutic
procedures could be produced by inducing the production of ES cells using
several transcription factors (Figure 9.13a) or by using nuclear transfer
techniques to produce blastocysts from which ES cells can be obtained

(Figure 9.13b). Although these processes only generate stem cells with
relatively low efficiency, this work does have considerable potential as a
means of producing different types of differentiated cells for use in the treatment of different diseases.
For our purposes however, studies involving the use of specific transcription factors to induce ES cell production focus attention on this small group
of transcription factors, since they are both specifically expressed in pluripotent ES cells and can achieve the reprogramming of differentiated cells into
ES-like cells. The expression of a relatively small number of transcription
factors in ES cells therefore induces their pluripotent phenotype and the
down-regulation of these factors allows the production of differentiated cells.

E
It appears that ES cell-specific transcription factors act in part by repressing
the expression of specific genes which are required for differentiation to
occur. For example, Oct4 and Nanog have been shown to interact with one
another and to bind to a variety of different target genes in ES cells. In turn,
such binding results in the recruitment of co-repressor complexes such as
NuRD and Sin3. These complexes contain histone deacetylases which are
able to induce the deacetylation of histones and thereby organize the DNA
into an inactive chromatin structure, incompatible with transcription
(Figure 9.14) (see Chapter 3, Section 3.3 for discussion of the effect of histone acetylation on chromatin structure).

Interestingly, Oct4, Nanog, and a third factor, Sox2, co-operate together
to repress the expression of the XIST gene in mouse ES cells. As discussed
in Chapter 3 (Section 3.6) expression of the long noncoding XIST RNA from
one of the two X chromosomes plays a key role in the inactivation of one of
the two X chromosomes present in cells of female mammalian embryos,
with the chromosome which expresses XIST being the one which is inactivated. As noted in Chapter 3 (Section 3.6), X inactivation occurs randomly
in the cells which form the tissues of the embryo so that different cells have
inactivated either the X chromosome derived from the mother’s genome or
that derived from the father’s genome.
However, this phase of random inactivation is preceded by an earlier
phase which occurs in the cells in the early embryo before formation of the
TE and the ICM cells. In these early undifferentiated cells, XIST is specifically
expressed from the paternal X chromosome resulting in the inactivation of
this chromosome (Figure 9.15). This is therefore an imprinting process
(see Chapter 3, Section 3.6) in which gene expression is regulated differently in the paternally and maternally inherited chromosomes.
Such imprinted expression of XIST and specific silencing of paternal X
chromosome is maintained in the extra-embryonic tissues produced from
the TE cells. However, in the ICM cells of the mouse embryo, XIST expression is extinguished and the paternal X chromosome is reactivated, thereby
allowing subsequent random inactivation of the maternal or paternal X
chromosomes to follow during cell differentiation (Figure 9.15).
It has been demonstrated that Oct4, Nanog, and Sox2 specifically bind to
the XIST gene on the paternal X chromosome and repress its expression, so
reversing the specific inactivation of this chromosome. During differentiation when the levels of these factors fall, XIST expression can be reactivated.
This takes place randomly on either the maternal or paternal chromosomes,
as described in Chapter 3 (Section 3.6), allowing different cells to inactivate
either the paternal or maternal X chromosomes (Figure 9.16).
Although Oct4, Sox2, and Nanog can therefore repress the expression of
specific genes in ES cells, they are also able to activate the expression of

tissue. In contrast, in the inner cell mass
cells, the expression of XIST from the

inactivated, so allowing both the maternal

Subsequently, XIST is randomly activated on
the maternal or paternal X chromosome in
different cells of the embryo, resulting in the
mouse embryo having a mixture of cells in
which either the maternal or the paternal
X chromosome has been inactivated

other genes which are required to maintain the pluripotent nature of ES
cells. Thus, it has been demonstrated that these three factors bind in combination to the regulatory regions of approximately 350 genes in the genome
of ES cells and that approximately 50% of these gene loci are transcriptionally activated as opposed to repressed in ES cells.
In many genes activated by Oct4, Sox2, and Nanog, multiple copies of
each transcription factor bind to enhancer elements associated with the
activated genes and then recruit the mediator complex (Figure 9.17)
(see Chapter 5, Section 5.2 for discussion of the mediator complex). These
enhancer elements differ from most enhancers (see Chapter 4, Section
4.4) in being much longer and having multiple densely packed binding
sites for Oct4, Sox2, and Nanog. They have therefore been termed
‘super-enhancers.’
Interestingly, when ES cells undergo their initial differentiation to form
endoderm cells (see above), Oct4 changes partner, dissociating from Sox2
and associating with another member of the Sox family, Sox17, to activate
endoderm-specific genes (Figure 9.18).

E
Among the genes activated by Oct4 are the genes encoding the histone
demethylases, Jmjd1a and Jmjd2c. These enzymes catalyze the demethylation of histone H3 on the lysine at position 9. As described in Chapter 2
(Section 2.3) and Chapter 3 (Section 3.3) methylation of histone H3 at this
position is associated with a closed chromatin structure, so that its demethylation produces an open chromatin structure allowing specific genes to be
expressed in ES cells (Figure 9.19).

REGULATION OF GENE EXPRESSION IN PLURIPOTENT EMBRYONIC STEM CELLS
FIgURe 9.19
oct4 activates the genes encoding the histone demethylases Jmjd1a
and Jmjd2c. this results in the demethylation of histone H3 at lysine 9
producing an open chromatin structure and the activation of specific
target genes required in embryonic stem (ES) cells.

In addition however, Oct4 can also activate the expression of genes
which promote a closed chromatin structure. Thus, Oct4 can co-operate
with the STAT3 transcription factor (see Chapter 8, Section 8.2) to activate
the gene encoding the Eed protein. This protein is a component of the polycomb complex (see below) which methylates histone H3 at the lysine at position 27 and thereby produces an inactive chromatin structure (Figure 9.20).
Hence, Oct4 can activate the expression of genes which produce a more
open chromatin structure at specific regions of the genome and also activate the expression of genes producing a closed chromatin structure,
thereby indirectly repressing gene expression in other regions of genome.
Such chromatin modifications will allow genes which need to be expressed
in the ES cells to be organized into an open chromatin structure compatible
with gene expression, while genes which must be repressed in ES cells are
organized into a closed chromatin structure incompatible with gene expression (compare Figures 9.19 and 9.20).
Interestingly, Oct4 can also indirectly repress gene expression by activating the genes encoding a variety of different miRNAs which, as described in
previous chapters, have a key role in post-transcriptional inhibition of gene
expression. For example, Oct4 co-operates with Sox2, Nanog, and another
transcription factor Tcf3, to activate the expression of the genes encoding
several miRNAs which then repress the expression of a number of different
target genes (Figure 9.21). In this case therefore, as in the Eed case, Oct4
represses gene expression indirectly by activating genes which produce
inhibitory factors.
The direct and indirect mechanisms of Oct4 action are combined in the
regulation of the genes encoding the DNA methyltransferases, Dmnt3a and
Dmnt3b, which as described in Chapter 3 (Section 3.2), play a key role in
the regulation of DNA methylation during embryonic development. Thus,
Oct4, Sox2, Nanog, and Tcf3 all co-operate together to activate the expression of the Dmnt3a and the Dmnt3b genes (Figure 9.22). In addition however, they also activate the expression of the genes encoding the miRNAs,
miR-290–295. In turn, these miRNAs repress the expression of another
transcription factor, Rbl2. As Rbl2 acts as a transcriptional repressor of the
Dmnt3a and Dmnt3b genes, this further stimulates the expression of
Dmnt3a and Dmnt3b (Figure 9.22).
Interestingly, as well as regulatory genes encoding proteins or small
miRNAs, ES cell-specific transcription factors also regulate the transcription
of long regulatory RNAs of 2 kb or greater in size which are expressed specifically in ES cells (see Chapter 1, Section 1.5, for general discussion of this
class of regulatory RNAs). Several such RNAs have been identified as being
activated by Oct4 and Nanog. As expected from this, the expression of these
RNAs declines when ES cells differentiate and one of these long RNAs has
been shown to be essential for the proliferation of undifferentiated ES cells.
Hence long regulatory RNAs which do not encode proteins appear to play a
key role in undifferentiated ES cells. Moreover, as well as activating the
expression of specific long RNAs, Oct4 can also repress the expression of
other long regulatory RNAs such as XIST (see above).
It is clear therefore that a small number of transcription factors maintain
the pluripotency of ES cells, acting both directly by activating and repressing
specific target genes and indirectly by altering the expression of genes
FIgURe 9.21
the transcription factors oct4, Sox2, Nanog, and tcf3 co-operate

The ability of these transcription factors to regulate a very wide variety of
genes, either directly or indirectly, is therefore responsible for their ability to
induce differentiated cells to revert to an ES cell-like undifferentiated state.

It is clear from the studies described above that chromatin structure plays a
key role in maintaining the pluripotent undifferentiated nature of ES cells.
Thus, Oct4 and the other ES cell transcription factors achieve their effects at
least in part by the regulation of chromatin structure. For example, Oct4 and
Nanog can recruit repressor complexes containing histone deacetylases to
their target genes and therefore organize a closed chromatin structure
incompatible with transcription (see Figure 9.14). Similarly, Oct4 can activate the expression of genes encoding histone methylases and demethylases which can then alter the chromatin structure of other target genes to
which Oct4 does not bind directly (see Figures 9.19 and 9.20).
In fact, genome-wide studies of histone modifications in undifferentiated ES cells have suggested that a number of genes in such cells may
contain unique patterns of histone modifications which are not normally
found in other cell types. Methylation of histone H3 on the lysine at position 4
is normally associated with an open chromatin structure (see Chapter 3,
Section 3.3) and indeed this modification is present at a number of genes
which are expressed in undifferentiated ES cells (Figure 9.23a). Similarly,
methylation of histone H3 on lysine 27 is associated with a closed chromatin structure in many cell types (see Chapter 3, Section 3.3) and is found in
ES cells at gene loci which are not expressed in the undifferentiated ES
cells or during their initial differentiation (Figure 9.23b).
Most interestingly however, some genes in ES cells are associated
with nucleosomes in which one molecule of histone H3 in the nucleosome is methylated on lysine 4 and the other molecule of histone H3 in
the same nucleosome is methylated on lysine 27 (Figure 9.23c). These
genes therefore have a so-called bivalent code in which they have both
an activating histone methylation (lysine 4) and an inhibitory histone
methylation (lysine 27) (see Chapter 2, Section 2.2, for discussion of
nucleosome structure in which each nucleosome contains two molecules
of each of the core histones.)
When the expression pattern of these genes containing the bivalent
code is studied, the majority are found to be repressed in ES cells but to be
rapidly expressed upon differentiation. Such expression is associated with
the loss of methylation at lysine 27 while methylation at lysine 4 is retained
(Figure 9.24). Such lysine 27 demethylation is catalyzed by specific
demethylase enzymes such as UTX, which become active as ES cells
differentiate.
It is likely therefore that the bivalent pattern of histone modification
allows the ES cells to remain pluripotent by not activating these genes due
to the presence of the inhibitory lysine 27 modification. However, the genes
are poised for rapid activation due to the presence of methylated lysine 4.
The bivalent code therefore represents a response to the unique nature of
FIgURe 9.23
Genes which are expressed in embryonic stem (ES) cells are associated
with nucleosomes (N) in which both molecules of histone H3 in the
nucleosome are methylated on lysine at position 4 (K4) but not on the
lysine at position 27 (K27), so producing an open chromatin structure
(a). In contrast, genes which are repressed in ES cells and in their initial
differentiated derivatives are associated with nucleosomes in which
both molecules of histone H3 are methylated on lysine 27 but not on
lysine 4, so producing a closed chromatin structure (b). Genes which are
repressed in ES cells but which need to be expressed immediately upon
differentiation are frequently associated with nucleosomes in which one
molecule of histone H3 is methylated on lysine 4 while the other molecule
of histone H3 is methylated on lysine 27, producing a chromatin structure
which is poised for transcriptional activation (c).

able to rapidly differentiate in response to appropriate signals.

The polycomb complex regulates histone methylation in eS cells
As discussed above, genes which are repressed in undifferentiated ES cells
but which need to be activated upon differentiation frequently exhibit a
bivalent modification of histone H3 involving methylation at both lysine 4
and lysine 27. The key role of this modification pattern in ensuring that these
genes are poised for activation immediately upon differentiation, focuses
attention on the proteins which catalyze such methylation events.
As described in Chapter 3 (Section 3.3), the activating methylation on
lysine 4 is produced by proteins of the trithorax family whereas the inhibitory modification on lysine 27 is produced by polycomb protein complexes. The trithorax and polycomb proteins were originally identified in
Drosophila where their inactivation by mutation resulted in flies with different abnormal body patterns. This is because these factors regulate the
expression of the genes encoding the homeodomain transcription factors,
which themselves play a key role in specifying the identity of different cell
types (see Chapter 5, Section 5.1 and Section 9.2 of this chapter). Thus, the
trithorax proteins activate specific homeodomain-containing genes in
particular cells by promoting an open chromatin structure. Inactivation of
the trithorax genes by mutation therefore results in abnormal flies due to
the lack of specific homeodomain gene expression in particular cells
(Figure 9.25).
Similarly, the polycomb proteins repress the inappropriate expression of
homeodomain-containing genes in specific cell types by organizing them
into an inactive chromatin structure. Inactivation of the polycomb genes by

the polycomb complex acts to maintain

allowing transcription to occur. mutation of
the polycomb complex therefore results in
inappropriate expression of homeodomaincontaining genes, whereas mutation of
the trithorax complex results in a lack
of expression of specific homeodomaincontaining genes.

mutation results in the inappropriate expression of homeodomain-containing
genes in particular cells, again producing a mutant fly with an abnormal
body pattern (Figure 9.25).
Although originally identified in Drosophila, both polycomb and trithorax
proteins have been found in a variety of different organisms, where they
play a critical role in the regulation of chromatin structure. In particular, it
has been shown that the polycomb proteins play a central role in maintaining the pluripotent nature of ES cells. Thus, the polycomb proteins prevent
ES cells expressing genes such as those encoding transcription factors
which are required to induce the production of specific types of differentiated cells. Genes repressed by polycomb include those encoding both
homeodomain-containing transcription factors and members of other transcription factor families.
Hence, the polycomb proteins prevent the inappropriate expression of
differentiation-specific transcription factor genes and thus allow ES cells to
maintain their pluripotent nature (Figure 9.26a). In agreement with this
idea, inactivation of the Eed protein, which is a component of the polycomb
protein complex, induces the premature activation of differentiationspecific genes in ES cells and results in their inappropriate differentiation
into a variety of different cell types (Figure 9.26b). Interestingly, as noted
above, the gene encoding Eed itself is a target for activation by the Oct4
transcription factor providing a link between Oct4 and the polycomb
proteins, both of which play a key role in regulating gene expression in
pluripotent ES cells (see Figure 9.20).
Two multiprotein polycomb complexes have been described and are
referred to as PRC1 and PRC2. The PRC2 complex binds to specific genes
and catalyzes histone H3 methylation on lysine 27. This methylation is then
recognized by PRC1 which binds to the methylated histones. The PRC1
complex can both bind to methylated lysine 27 and also catalyze further
lysine 27 methylation (Figure 9.27).
This dual activity of PRC1 in recognizing methylated lysine 27 and also
catalyzing further methylation, ensures that lysine 27 methylation is propagated through multiple cell divisions. Following cell division, each daughter
chromosome will initially have some methylated histone H3 inherited from
the parental chromosome and some newly bound unmethylated histone
H3. The dual activity of PRC1 will allow it to bind via the methylated histone
and then methylate the unmethylated histone (Figure 9.28) (see Chapter 3,
Section 3.3, for discussion of a similar mechanism involving the HP1

the dual activity of PRC1 allows histone methylation on lysine 27 (K27) to
be maintained through cell division, thereby maintaining the pluripotent
nature of embryonic stem (ES) cells. Following DNA replication, each
chromosome will have some methylated histone H3 inherited from the
parental chromosome and some newly deposited unmethylated histone
H3 (only one daughter chromosome is shown for simplicity). PRC1 can
both bind to the methylated histone H3 and catalyze methylation of the
unmethylated histone H3, thereby restoring the full methylation pattern.

protein). Such maintenance of histone 27 methylation through cell division
is obviously of vital importance since ES cells must maintain their pluripotent nature through multiple cell divisions before eventually differentiating.
As well as being recruited to its target genes via PRC2-induced methylation of histone H3, PRC1 can also be recruited to target genes in a PRC2independent manner. In this case, PRC1 binds to the histone demethylase
enzyme Kdm2b. In turn, Kdm2b is recruited to the DNA by binding to unmethylated CG islands (Figure 9.29). As discussed in Chapter 3 (Section 3.2)
unmethylated C residues are normally associated with active genes and
unmethylated CG islands are found in genes expressed in a variety of cell
types. Hence, in this case, the repressive PRC1 complex is recruited via a
signal normally associated with active genes. As with the presence of the
activating lysine 4 histone methylation in genes repressed in ES cells (see
above), this effect is likely to reflect the need to repress specific genes in ES
cells and rapidly activate them upon differentiation.

The polycomb protein complexes have been shown by chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) analysis (see Chapter 4, Methods Box 4.3) to be
associated with the regulatory regions of several hundred genes in ES cells.
As described above, many of these will be genes encoding specific
transcription factors which play a key role in differentiation and which
therefore must be maintained in an inactive state poised for activation in ES
cells. Interestingly however, the polycomb repressor complexes also associate in ES cells with the regulatory regions of a number of genes encoding
microRNAs (miRNAs). Thus as described above, the genes encoding a number of different miRNAs are activated in ES cells due to the binding of the
transcription factors Oct4, Sox2, Nanog, and Tcf3 (see Figure 9.21).
However, a number of other genes encoding different miRNAs also bind
Oct4, Sox2, Nanog, and Tcf3. This second class of miRNA genes are not
expressed in ES cells due to the simultaneous binding of polycomb repressor complexes which prevents the expression of these genes in pluripotent
ES cells (Figure 9.30). As ES cells differentiate into various cell types, polycomb repression is relieved and specific miRNAs are expressed. For example, the gene encoding miR-132 is silenced by polycomb in ES cells but
becomes active when they differentiate into muscle cells. Similarly, the
gene encoding miR-124 is silenced in ES cells by polycomb complexes but
becomes active as ES cells differentiate into neural precursor cells (see
Chapter 10, Sections 10.1 and 10.2 for discussion of the role of microRNAs
in regulating gene expression in muscle and nerve cells, respectively).
Hence, the role of polycomb complexes in regulating histone methylation

and thereby ensuring that differentiation-specific genes are repressed but
poised for activation in ES cells is not confined to protein-coding genes but
also occurs for genes which produce miRNAs (Figure 9.31).

Chromatin structure in eS cells is regulated by multiple effects
on histones
As discussed above, the regulation of histone methylation plays a key role in
modulating chromatin structure in ES cells. It has been demonstrated however, that a number of the other effects on histones discussed in Chapter 2
(Section 2.3) and Chapter 3 (Section 3.3) also play important roles in ES cells.
For example, it has been shown that the histone H2 variant H2AZ (see
Chapter 2, Section 2.3), co-operates with polycomb proteins to regulate
chromatin structure in ES cells. Similarly, a specific enzyme known as SCNY,
which removes ubiquitin from histone H2B, is necessary for the repression
of specific genes in undifferentiated ES cells. Moreover, the inactivation of
this enzyme not only increases ubiquitination of histone H2B but also results
in the premature differentiation of the ES cells (Figure 9.32).
During the normal differentiation of ES cells, SCNY is down-regulated
producing enhanced ubiquitination of histone H2B. As described in Chapter
3 (Section 3.3) this has the effect of enhancing methylation of histone H3 on
lysines 4 and 79, providing an example of the modification of one histone
influencing the modification of another histone. Overall, these changes in
ubiquitination and methylation will have the effect of opening up the chromatin structure of specific genes which must be transcribed in differentiated
ES cells but not in the undifferentiated cells (Figure 9.32).

active genes that are separated by large distances on the same chromosome
or are located on different chromosomes. These looping patterns can be
detected by the 3C and related techniques (see Chapter 2, Section 2.5 and
Methods Box 2.2, for description of these techniques).
The application of these techniques to ES cells has detected a highly
ordered looping structure which brings together distant genes that are specifically transcribed in ES cells (Figure 9.33). Moreover, such interactions
between these normally distant genes are critically dependent on ES
cell-specific transcription factors such as Oct4 and Nanog and the superenhancer elements that contain multiple binding sites for such factors,
which were described above (Figure 9.33) (see also Figure 9.17).
These findings reinforce the importance of chromatin structure in gene
regulation in ES cells, both at the level of the individual genes and at the
level of the interaction between different co-expressed genes.

The regulation of chromatin structure in eS cells plays a critical
role in maintaining their undifferentiated nature and in their
ability to differentiate into a variety of cell types
Regulation of chromatin structure by polycomb complexes and other
mechanisms therefore plays a key role in regulating gene expression in ES
cells and their differentiated derivatives. When taken together with the
effects of ES cell-specific transcription factors such as Oct4, these effects on
transcription and chromatin structure allow ES cells to retain their pluripotent nature while being poised for differentiation along a variety of different
pathways.
Many of the mechanisms involved in regulating chromatin structure in
ES cells are typical of those found in all cell types. These include the use of
methylation of histone H3 on lysine 27 and the de-ubiquitination of histone
H2B to repress specific genes in ES cells (see above). As we have seen however, other changes in chromatin structure appear to operate in ES cells in
a manner different to other cell types. These include the methylation of histone H3 on lysine 4 in repressed genes, although it is normally associated
with activation, and the role of unmethylated CG islands in recruiting the
repressive PRC1 complex.
These findings have led to the idea that the natural state of chromatin in
ES cells is an open one with low levels of DNA methylation and a high activity of ATP-dependent chromatin-remodeling enzymes which act to open the
chromatin structure (see Chapter 3, Section 3.5) (Figure 9.34). The histone
code discussed above (see Figure 9.23), can then act to either allow the
gene to retain an open chromatin structure and therefore be expressed in
undifferentiated ES cells (Figure 9.34a) or to produce different patterns of
closed chromatin in which the gene is repressed in undifferentiated ES cells
and is either not activated (Figure 9.34b) or rapidly activated in their differentiated derivatives (Figure 9.34c).

G
Clearly, the evidence discussed above indicates that transcriptional regulation is of critical importance in ES cells, operating both at the level of chromatin structure and at the level of DNA-binding transcription factors.
However, as in other cell types, gene control in ES cells also involves

Indeed, we have already discussed above the manner in which ES-cell
specific transcription factors such as Oct4 induce the production of specific
miRNAs which ensure that genes expressed in differentiated ES cells
are effectively repressed in undifferentiated ES cells (see Figure 9.21).
Moreover, the Lin-28 protein which together with three transcription factors (Oct4, Sox2, and Nanog) can induce ES cell production from differentiated cells (see Figure 9.12), is actually a factor which modulates the
processing of miRNA precursors to produce mature miRNAs (see Chapter 7,
Section 7.7) further indicating the importance of miRNAs in regulating
gene expression in pluripotent ES cells. As discussed in Chapter 7 (see
Section 7.7) miRNAs repress gene expression post-transcriptionally (by
inducing degradation of target mRNAs and blocking their translation into
protein) and miRNAs clearly act in this manner in ES cells and their differentiated derivatives.
Interestingly, miR-302, one of the miRNAs induced by Oct4, posttranscriptionally represses the expression of the gene encoding the NR2F2
transcription factor which is required for neuronal differentiation of ES
cells. Moreover, Oct4 itself represses the NR2F2 gene at the transcriptional
level so ensuring strong repression of NR2F2 expression in undifferentiated
ES cells (Figure 9.35). In addition, the Oct4 gene is a target for transcriptional repression by NR2F2. Hence, when ES cells are induced to differentiate to neuronal cells, an initial rise in NR2F2 expression results in the
transcriptional repression of Oct4 expression. As Oct4 levels fall, a positive
feedback loop results leading to a large increase in NR2F2 expression, both
due to the release of transcriptional repression by Oct4 itself and of
post-transcriptional repression by the Oct4-induced miR-302 (Figure 9.35).
As well as being regulated by Oct4 and miR-302, NR2F2 is also regulated
at the level of alternative splicing to produce different forms of the protein
with or without the DNA-binding domain (see Chapter 7, Section 7.1 for
discussion of alternative splicing), providing an example of the role of alternative splicing in gene regulation in ES cells.
Indeed, there is considerable evidence that such alternative splicing
operates on a number of different genes expressed in undifferentiated ES
cells and their differentiated derivatives. Thus, a recent study identified a
very large number of alternative splicing events which were differentially

regulated in ES cells and their differentiated derivates. Moreover, it identified
two proteins, MBNL1 and MBNL2, which were expressed at very low levels
in undifferentiated ES cells with expression increasing upon differentiation
and which play a key role in regulating many of these alternative splicing
events. Thus, increasing the expression of MBNL1 and MBNL2 in undifferentiated ES cells switched the pattern of a number of alternative splicing events
to that normally observed in differentiated ES cells, whereas inhibiting their
expression in differentiated ES cells had the opposite effect (Figure 9.36a).
One of the target genes whose splicing is regulated by MBNL1 and
MBNL2 is the FOXP1 transcription factor. In undifferentiated ES cells, exon
18b of FOXP1 is included in the final mRNA and exon 18 is excluded,
whereas in differentiated cells the reverse is true (Figure 9.37). In turn, this
results in the FOXP1 protein having a different DNA-binding specificity and
therefore binding to different target genes in ES cells and their differentiated
derivatives. Only the ES cell form of FOXP1 can bind to the Oct4 promoter
and activate its expression, so ensuring that the Oct4 protein is present at
enhanced levels in ES cells (Figure 9.37).
Interestingly, recent studies have identified another alternative splicing
factor SON, which is expressed at high levels in undifferentiated ES cells
and not in their differentiated derivatives, the opposite expression pattern
to MBNL1 and MBNL2. SON regulates the correct splicing of ES cell-specific
proteins such as Oct4 itself. Moreover, its artificial overexpression in differentiated cells produces an ES cell pattern of alternative splicing while
reduction in its levels in undifferentiated ES cells has the opposite effect
(Figure 9.36b).
It is clear therefore that post-transcriptional regulation plays a key role
in the regulation of gene expression in ES cells, operating at the level of
alternative splicing and via miRNA-mediated mRNA degradation and inhibition of mRNA translation. Together with transcriptional regulation at the

level of chromatin structure and DNA-binding transcription factors, this
allows ES cells to combine their undifferentiated state with their ability to
differentiate into a variety of different cell types.
As will be discussed in Chapter 10, a variety of mechanisms exist to
ensure that different cell types, such as muscle or nerve cells, exhibit the
appropriate pattern of cell type-specific gene expression. However, during
embryonic development it is necessary to ensure that such cellular differentiation and the associated cell type-specific patterns of gene expression
occur at the appropriate time and place relative to the formation of other
cell types. Our understanding of these processes has been greatly aided by
analysis of the fruit fly Drosophila in which the techniques of molecular biology can readily be combined with genetic analysis of mutant flies having a
particular phenotype. The insights obtained in this system are discussed in
the next section.

A gradient in expression of the Bicoid transcription factor
plays a key role in defining the anterior–posterior axis
in the early Drosophila embryo
The fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster has been extremely well characterized
genetically. In particular, a number of gene mutations have been identified,
each of which can produce a fly with a specific abnormal body pattern.
Analysis of these genes has shown that the majority of them encode transcription factors including homeodomain-containing transcription factors
such as Bicoid and Antennapedia, as well as zinc finger-containing transcription factors such as Kruppel and Hunchback (see Chapter 5, Section
5.1, for discussion of these classes of transcription factors). As will be discussed in this section, the combination of molecular and genetic techniques
available in Drosophila has provided considerable information on the key
role of gene control processes in Drosophila development. Moreover, as will
be discussed in Section 9.3, such studies have also provided insights into
the processes regulating mammalian development.
The development of Drosophila begins, however, in a way very different
from the early mammalian developmental processes which were discussed
above. Following fertilization, 13 successive rounds of nuclear division
occur without any division of the cytoplasm, so producing a single syncytial
structure. In this syncytial structure, a single mass of cytoplasm surrounds
approximately 1500 nuclei which progressively migrate to the periphery of
the embryo (Figure 9.38). Only then does cell division occur to produce
individual cells containing only one nucleus, around the periphery of the
embryo. Clearly, in order to differentiate into different cell types, these cells
need to respond in some manner to their position within the embryo, i.e.
whether they are anterior or posterior or whether they are dorsal or ventral
(Figure 9.38).
A key role in this process is played by the Bicoid homeodomaincontaining transcription factor. As described in Chapter 7 (Section 7.4),
sequences in the 3′ untranslated region of the Bicoid mRNA result in its
preferential localization at the anterior end of the embryo. A gradient in
Bicoid expression is therefore created within the embryo in which the
concentration of Bicoid is highest at the anterior end and then declines progressively towards the posterior end. This gradient in Bicoid expression is
critical for defining the anterior–posterior axis of Drosophila, since mutation
in the Bicoid gene results in the absence of the head and thoracic structures
of the animal.
Importantly, genes which are activated by the Bicoid transcription factor
contain binding sites in their promoters which have either high affinity or
low affinity for the Bicoid protein. The presence of high- or low-affinity binding sites (or a combination of the two) in different promoters results in the
different genes being activated at different concentration levels of Bicoid.
Thus, genes with high-affinity binding sites will be activated at both low
and high concentrations of Bicoid, whereas genes with low-affinity sites will
be activated only at high Bicoid concentrations. Hence, the gradient in
Bicoid expression in the egg is converted into a pattern of gene expression,
with some genes being activated only at the most anterior end of the egg
since they require a high concentration of Bicoid, whereas others are

Early development in the Drosophila melanogaster embryo involves nuclear
replication without cytoplasmic division to produce a syncytium containing
multiple nuclei in a common cytoplasm. Subsequently, the nuclei migrate
to the periphery of the syncytium and cell division then occurs. During
development individual cells in the embryo will differentiate according to
their position along the anterior–posterior axis or the dorsal–ventral axis.

activated over a greater region of the egg since they require only a lower
concentration of Bicoid for activation (Figure 9.39).
Many of the genes whose expression is activated by Bicoid are also
repressed by the Runt transcription factor. Runt is expressed at low levels at
the anterior end of the embryo and its level increases more posteriorly
(Figure 9.40). Hence, target genes regulated in this manner will be
expressed at high levels anteriorly where Bicoid levels are high and Runt
levels are low whereas they will be expressed at low levels more posteriorly
where the converse is true (Figure 9.40).

Bicoid activates a cascade of genes encoding other transcription
factors producing a segmented pattern of Eve gene expression
Most importantly, the genes activated by Bicoid include genes encoding
other regulatory transcription factors. Thus, Bicoid activates the gene encoding the zinc finger-containing gene Hunchback in a concentration-dependent
manner. This results in the gradient in Bicoid expression (Figure 9.41a)
being converted into a gradient in Hunchback expression (Figure 9.41b). In
turn, this results in gradients at opposite ends of the egg in the expression of
the Giant and Kruppel transcription factors, which are respectively activated
or repressed by Hunchback (Figure 9.41c).
All these transcription factors then act on the promoter of the gene
encoding the Eve (Even-skipped) homeodomain-containing transcription
factor. However, while Bicoid and Hunchback activate Eve expression,
Giant and Kruppel repress it. This produces a narrow band or stripe of Eve
gene expression, known as Eve stripe 2 (Figure 9.41d).
The Bicoid protein therefore has the properties of a morphogen whose
concentration gradient plays an important role in determining position in
the anterior part of the embryo. As expected from this, experimental manipulation of the Bicoid gradient produces dramatic effects on the embryo.
Cells which contain artificially increased levels of Bicoid assume a phenotype which is normally characteristic of more anterior cells that normally
contain that level of Bicoid. In contrast, cells which have artificially lowered
levels of Bicoid assume a phenotype which is normally characteristic of
more posterior cells.
As would be expected, mutations in the other genes which regulate Eve
expression also produce abnormal Drosophila. For example, mutation of
the Kruppel gene produces a larval fly lacking all three thoracic segments
and the first five of the eight abdominal segments. Kruppel is therefore an
example of a gap gene whose mutation produces an absence of a significant number of adjacent segments.
As described above, the combination of the four transcription factors
Bicoid, Hunchback, Giant, and Kruppel results in a defined band or stripe of
Eve gene expression (stripe 2) (Figure 9.42a). This can be produced by
linking a 450 bp region of the Eve gene promoter to a marker gene and then
inserting this gene into the embryo (Figure 9.42b). This indicates that the
four transcription factors act on a defined region of the Eve gene promoter
to produce stripe 2 expression. In fact, the Eve gene is expressed in seven
specific stripes in the Drosophila embryo, each of which is produced by

combinations of transcription factors acting on different regions of the Eve
gene promoter (Figure 9.42c and d). Interestingly, computer models have
now been produced which can predict the specific expression pattern of
target genes such as Eve on the basis of the expression patterns of their
upstream regulators and the number and affinity of the binding sites for
these regulators in the target gene promoter.
The pattern of Eve gene expression allows the Eve protein to play a key
role in producing the segmented pattern of Drosophila. Thus, mutation of
the Eve gene produces a larva which lacks every alternate segment. Eve is
thus an example of a pair-rule gene, whose mutation results in the larva
having half the normal number of segments. Interestingly, while mutation
of Eve results in the absence of the even-numbered segments (for example,
abdominal segments A2, A4, A6, and A8), mutation of another pair-rule
gene, Fushi-Tarazu, results in the absence of the odd-numbered segments,
indicating that these two transcription factors have complementary roles.

The Bicoid system involves both transcriptional and
post-transcriptional regulation
The Bicoid system illustrates the importance of transcription factors and
transcriptional control in the early development of the Drosophila embryo.
It should be noted however, that this process is initiated by mechanisms
which regulate RNA transport so that the Bicoid mRNA is located at the
anterior end of the egg (see Chapter 7, Section 7.4).
Moreover, other post-transcriptional processes are also involved in early
Drosophila development. For example, it has been shown that as well as
regulating transcription, the Bicoid protein can also regulate mRNA translation. The anterior to posterior gradient in Bicoid expression is required to
produce a posterior–anterior gradient in the expression of another protein,
Caudal. Unlike the Bicoid mRNA however, the Caudal mRNA is uniformly
distributed throughout the embryo, indicating that Bicoid does not regulate
Caudal gene transcription. Rather, Bicoid inhibits translation of the Caudal
mRNA so that Caudal protein is only produced at the posterior end of the
embryo where Bicoid levels are low (Figure 9.43). Hence, Bicoid can regulate both gene transcription and mRNA translation. Moreover, Bicoid regulates Caudal mRNA translation by binding to the Caudal mRNA, indicating
that the homeodomain can interact with RNA as well as with DNA (see
Chapter 7, Section 7.6 for further discussion of translational control).
Although synthesis of Bicoid is controlled by regulating the location of
its mRNA, the Bicoid system illustrates the importance of the regulated
synthesis of specific transcription factors such as Hunchback, Kruppel,
Giant, etc., in producing a hierarchy of transcription factor expression in the
early Drosophila embryo. Most importantly, this can convert a simple

anterior–posterior gradient in the expression of one transcription factor
(Bicoid) into a defined band or stripe in the expression of another transcription factor (Eve). These processes therefore produce a segmented pattern in
the early Drosophila embryo. Ultimately, this will result in different regions
of the body developing from the different segments. Thus far however, we
have only described processes which produce a segmented pattern rather
than those which lead to different segments developing different identities.
This is discussed below.

As discussed above, a hierarchy of genes encoding specific transcription
factors can convert an initial anterior–posterior gradient into a striped pattern of gene expression which defines the segmental structure of Drosophila.
Thus, the gradient in egg-polarity genes such as Bicoid is converted into
the broad expression patterns of gap genes such as Hunchback and Kruppel
and then into the multiple stripe pattern of pair-rule genes such as Eve
(Figure 9.41 and Figure 9.44). In turn, egg-polarity genes, gap genes, and
pair-rule genes co-operate together to induce expression of the homeotic
selector genes whose protein products actually determine which structures each particular segment will form (Figure 9.44).
As described in Chapter 5 (Section 5.1), such genes were originally identified on the basis that their mutation results in abnormal flies in which one
particular structure (such as an antenna) was absent and was replaced with
an additional copy of another structure (such as a leg) (see Figure 5.4).
When the genes encoding these homeotic selector genes were isolated and
characterized, they were found to encode homeodomain-containing transcription factors identifying this family of transcription factors for the first
time (see Chapter 5, Section 5.1).
The genes encoding these homeodomain-containing transcription factors are located on chromosome 3 in Drosophila and are organized into two
clusters, the Antennapedia cluster and the Bithorax cluster (Figure 9.45).
Most interestingly, the order of the genes in the clusters corresponds to the
anterior–posterior order of the segments whose identity they control. Thus,
the first gene in the Antennapedia cluster is labial palps, which controls the
formation of the most anterior segment of the fly while the last gene in the
Bithorax cluster is Abdominal B, which specifies the identity of the most
posterior segment (Figure 9.45).
Clearly, a complex pattern of transcriptional regulatory proteins will be
required to ensure that each homeotic selector gene is expressed in the
appropriate segment. Such transcriptional regulatory proteins acting on the
promoters of these genes will evidently include the products of egg-polarity
genes, gap genes, and pair-rule genes (as illustrated in Figure 9.44), which
themselves are distributed in complex patterns in the Drosophila embryo
(Figure 9.46b). Similarly, the homeotic selector genes will be regulated by
modulators of chromatin structure, such as the polycomb and trithorax proteins described in Chapter 3 (Section 3.3) and in Section 9.1 of this Chapter
(Figure 9.46a). The polycomb proteins will act to repress inappropriate
expression of homeodomain genes in the wrong segments while the trithorax proteins will ensure that the appropriate homeodomain genes are maintained in an open chromatin structure and can therefore be activated in the
appropriate segment (see also Figure 9.25).
Similarly, as described in Chapter 5 (Section 5.1) some homeodomaincontaining transcription factors (such as Ubx) are able to induce their own

the Caudal mRNA is distributed throughout

where bicoid levels are low. this produces
a posterior to anterior gradient in Caudal
protein levels in the Drosophila embryo,
paralleling the anterior to posterior bicoid
gradient.

expression, so ensuring that their expression is maintained in a particular
segment once it has been switched on (Figure 9.46c) (see also Figure 5.8).

P
Clearly, as described in Chapter 5 (Section 5.1) the homeotic selector genes
encode transcription factors which bind to specific DNA sequences via the
helix-turn-helix motif in the homeodomain. Each homeotic selector gene
will therefore activate and/or repress the expression of specific target genes
required in particular segments. However, this will not occur simply by each
homeotic selector gene being expressed only in a particular segment and
modulating the expression of its target genes in that segment. Rather, the
effect of a particular homeodomain transcription factor will be affected by
the presence or absence of other homeodomain or nonhomeodomain transcription factors.
Thus, several homeodomain proteins such as Ubx and Antp appear to
have the same DNA-binding target site when tested in vitro. However, in
the intact cell, only Ubx can bind to the promoter of the Dpp gene and
regulate its expression whereas Antp cannot do so. This difference correlates with the finding that inactivation of Ubx by mutation produces a
completely different mutant fly than that which is produced by mutation
of Antp.
These effects are explained by the finding that the Dpp promoter contains both a binding site for Ubx and an adjacent binding site for another
homeodomain-containing protein, known as extradenticle (Exd). As
described in Chapter 5 (Section 5.1), the Exd and Ubx proteins interact with
one another on the Dpp promoter, so allowing Ubx to bind strongly to the
promoter and regulate its expression (Figure 9.47). This effect does not
occur with Antp because Antp and Exd do not interact.
This example therefore indicates how different homeodomain-containing
transcription factors can have different effects on gene expression depending on whether or not they interact with another transcription factor.
Moreover, this Drosophila example of a homeodomain-containing transcription factor having its DNA-binding specificity modified by an interaction with another factor is paralleled in the yeast mating-type system (see
Chapter 10, Section 10.3). In this system, the DNA-binding specificity of the
α2 homeodomain protein is modified differently by interaction with either
the homeodomain-containing a1 factor or the nonhomeodomain transcription factor MCM1 (see Figure 10.59).
This parallel between the yeast and Drosophila systems can be extended
further. Thus, the key role of the Drosophila homeodomain transcription
factors in controlling the identity of specific segments is paralleled by the
role of the yeast a and α homeodomain factors in producing the a and α
mating types (see Chapter 10, Section 10.3). This vital role of homeodomaincontaining transcription factors is also observed in vertebrates such as
mammals, as discussed in the next section.

Following the findings that a number of genes involved in Drosophila development encode homeodomain-containing transcription factors, Southern

homologous genes in other organisms including mammals. Subsequently,
these genes were characterized and it was confirmed that they do indeed
encode homeodomain-containing transcription factors.
Homeodomain-containing genes therefore exist in vertebrates including mammals, as well as in yeast and Drosophila. Indeed, detailed analysis

homologous to specific Drosophila homeodomain genes such as Engrailed
and Deformed, with the homology between the Drosophila and mammalian
proteins extending beyond the homeodomain into other regions of the
proteins.
The mammalian homeodomain-containing genes are organized into
four gene clusters known as the HoxA, HoxB, HoxC, and HoxD gene clusters, paralleling the existence of homeodomain-gene clusters in Drosophila
(Figure 9.48). Moreover, the order of the genes in the mammalian clusters parallels the order of their Drosophila counterparts. For example, in
the HoxB cluster on mouse chromosome 11, the first gene in the complex,
HoxB1, is most homologous to the first gene in the Drosophila cluster,
labial palps (Figure 9.48). This pattern continues across the clusters with
each gene in the mouse cluster being most homologous to the corresponding gene in the Drosophila cluster until the HoxB9 gene, which is
most homologous to the last gene in the Drosophila cluster, Abdominal B
(Figure 9.48).

Mammalian Hox genes are expressed in specific
regions of the developing embryo
As noted in Section 9.2 above, the order of the genes in the Drosophila
homeodomain gene cluster on chromosome 3 correlates with their functional roles, genes at one end of the cluster being critical for the specification of anterior structures while those at the other end of the cluster specify
the posterior structures. This functional correlation is observed in the mammalian system also. The genes in the HoxB cluster are all expressed in the
developing central nervous system and play a key role in its formation. In
the central nervous system, the expression pattern of each gene is related to
its position in the cluster. Thus, the HoxB1 gene is the first gene in the cluster to be expressed and shows the most anterior boundary of gene expression (Figure 9.49), while each successive gene in the cluster is expressed
progressively later during embryonic development and progressively less
anteriorly (Figure 9.49 and Figure 9.50).

to a reporter gene they direct different expression patterns when introduced

expression and the highest retinoic acid
responsiveness, whereas the B9 gene is
expressed at the latest point in embryonic
development, its expression is restricted
to the posterior region, and it shows low
retinoic acid responsiveness.

into a mouse embryo (Figure 9.51). This indicates that the differences in
expression of the different HoxB genes in the embryo are produced at least
in part by transcriptional regulatory processes acting on the control regions
of each gene.
One possible mechanism for this effect is provided by the finding that the
genes in the HoxB cluster are differentially sensitive to induction with retinoic acid (Figure 9.49). As described in Chapter 5 (Section 5.1), retinoic acid
regulates gene expression by binding to its receptor (which is a member of
the nuclear receptor transcription factor family) and thereby regulates
expression of its target genes. In this manner, retinoic acid plays a key role
in vertebrate development and particularly in the development of the nervous system.
There is considerable evidence that gradients in the levels of retinoic acid
exist in the embryo. Such an anterior to posterior gradient in retinoic acid
levels could account for the pattern of expression of the HoxB genes in the
developing nervous system. It has been shown that the HoxB1 gene is the
most sensitive to activation by low levels of retinoic acid, with sensitivity
declining across the complex so that each successive gene requires higher
levels of retinoic acid for its activation (Figure 9.49). Hence a gradient in
retinoic acid, with the highest level being found in the posterior part of the
central nervous system and levels declining anteriorly, would result in the
observed pattern of gene expression with HoxB1 being expressed most anteriorly and the other genes progressively less anteriorly (Figure 9.52).
Regulation of the Hox genes by retinoic acid represents an example
of the expression of genes encoding one set of transcription factors, namely
the Hox proteins, being regulated by another family of transcription factors,
namely the retinoic acid receptors. In agreement with this, the HoxB1
gene has been shown to contain a retinoic acid response element in its
3′ regulatory region, which can bind the retinoic acid receptor. Moreover,

linkage of the regulatory regions of either
the HoxB2 gene or the HoxB4 gene to a

by transcriptional regulation. Courtesy of

model in which the anterior boundary of gene expression in the HoxB
cluster is controlled by a retinoic acid gradient. Since the HoxB1 gene
is most sensitive to activation by retinoic acid, it will be expressed most
anteriorly while the other genes will have progressively less anterior
boundaries of expression due to the progressively reduced sensitivity
to activation by retinoic acid.

inactivation of this element by mutation so that it can no longer bind the

Hox gene transcription is also dependent on the position
of the gene in the Hox gene cluster
Specific sequences adjacent to or within individual Hox genes can therefore
result in their regulation at the transcriptional level, for example, by retinoic
acid receptors. Such regulatory processes are supplemented by processes
which regulate the transcription of Hox genes according to their position in
the gene cluster. Thus, if individual Hox genes (and their adjacent regulatory
elements) are moved to a different position within the gene cluster, their
pattern of expression is altered so that it resembles that of the gene normally located at that position in the cluster, for example in terms of the time
at which the gene is switched on during development (Figure 9.54).
In the case of the HoxD gene cluster, the gene located at one end of the
cluster, HoxD13, is expressed most anteriorly and at the highest level with
each successive gene being expressed at lower levels and more posteriorly.
If HoxD13 is deleted, the next gene in the cluster, HoxD12, is expressed in
the manner typical of HoxD13 even though it remains in its normal position
(Figure 9.55).
These studies indicate therefore that, in addition to gene-specific regulatory sequences, Hox genes are regulated according to their position in the
gene cluster by processes which operate on all genes in the cluster. In the
case of the HoxD gene cluster, this appears to be dependent on a distant
enhancer element known as the general control region (GCR) which is
located at least 100,000 bases away from the gene cluster. The HoxD genes
compete to interact with this GCR enhancer element so that the closest gene
interacts most strongly and is expressed in a particular pattern, and so on
(Figure 9.55). This effect is evidently similar to that which occurs in the
β-globin gene cluster (see Chapter 2, Section 2.5) in which individual
β-globin-like genes are expressed in a specific order during development
that is determined by their position relative to a single control element, the
locus control region.

Changes in chromatin structure play a key role in activating the
expression of Hox genes and in their spatial/temporal pattern of
gene expression
In view of their key role in inducing differentiation, Hox genes must be
silenced in ES cells. As discussed above (Section 9.1) this is achieved at
least in part by the polycomb protein complexes, PRC1 and PRC2, which
produce a tightly packed chromatin structure of the Hox genes which is
incompatible with transcription. As cells differentiate and individual Hox
genes are activated, polycomb repression will be relieved and the gene will
move into a more open chromatin structure.

ROLE OF HOMEODOMAIN FACTORS IN MAMMALIAN DEVELOPMENT
FIgURe 9.55
A distant enhancer element, known as the general control region (GCR),
regulates the expression of the genes in the HoxD gene cluster acting
more strongly on the more adjacent genes (a). the deletion of one gene
in the cluster (gene C) results in another gene (gene b) being the closest
to the enhancer. It is therefore expressed in the normal pattern of gene C
even though its physical location is unchanged (b).

It has been shown that in neuronal cells, such as those in the anterior
region of the brain where all the Hox genes in a specific cluster are inactive,
they associate into a single three-dimensional structure with tightly packed
chromatin in which histone H3 is methylated on lysine 27. As specific genes
at one end of the cluster become activated in progressively more posterior
regions of the brain, they move into a transcriptionally active compartment
with a different pattern of DNA looping and chromatin structure characterized by methylation on lysine 4 of histone H3, so resulting in a bimodal 3D
structure containing active and inactive genes, respectively (Figure 9.56
and compare Figure 9.50).
It is clear therefore that changes in chromatin structure of the DNA and
in DNA looping (see Chapter 4, Section 4.4 for discussion of DNA looping)
play a vital role in regulating the temporal and spatial pattern of Hox gene
expression. DNA looping changes are likely to function at least in part by
bringing the GCR enhancer element (see Figure 9.55) into close association with the promoter elements of different Hox genes. Moreover, it has
been demonstrated that long regulatory noncoding RNAs (see Chapter 1,
Section 1.5) are of importance in regulating DNA looping and hence the
proximity of different DNA regions in the Hox gene cluster.

Hox gene expression is also regulated at the post-transcriptional
level by specific miRNAs
The findings discussed above indicate that Hox gene expression is regulated at
least in part at the transcriptional/chromatin structure level, both by sequences
adjacent to the gene itself and by its position in the gene cluster. In addition
however, there is considerable evidence that regulation of Hox gene expression also occurs at the post-transcriptional level. It has been shown that specific miRNAs are encoded within the Hox gene clusters and can inhibit the
expression of specific genes in that cluster and in other Hox gene clusters. For
example, the miRNA miR-10a is produced from a region of DNA between the
HoxB4 and B5 genes and can bind to a sequence in the 3′ untranslated region
of the HoxB3 mRNA, thereby inhibiting HoxB3 expression (Figure 9.57).
Similarly the miRNA, miR-196a-1, is produced from a region downstream of the HoxB9 gene and can inhibit the expression of the HoxB1, B6,
B7, and B8 genes (Figure 9.57). Moreover, such miRNAs do not act solely on
genes in the cluster from which they are produced. For example, miR-10a
also inhibits genes in other Hox clusters, such as the HoxA1, A3, A5, and A7
genes, as well as the HoxD10 gene. Similarly, miR-196a-1 can inhibit expression of the HoxA5, A7, and A9 genes as well as of the HoxC8 and D8 genes.
As well as miRNA-mediated post-transcriptional control, a novel mechanism regulating Hox mRNA translation has been described. Thus, a mouse
mutant known as tail short lacks functional ribosomal protein 38 (RPL38)
which is part of the large ribosomal subunit (see Chapter 6, Section 6.6 for
discussion of ribosomal structure) and exhibits skeletal pattern defects. It
has been shown that this is because ribosomes lacking RPL38 show
reduced translation of specific Hox mRNAs so resulting in lowered levels of
specific Hox proteins, although the translation of other mRNAs is unaffected (Figure 9.58). Interestingly, RPL38 is expressed at high levels during development compared with adult tissue, consistent with a role in Hox
gene mRNA translation. In addition to being of importance in the study of
Hox gene expression, these studies indicate that the composition of the
ribosome may be cell type-specific. Thus, the ribosomes from different cell
types may show differences in protein composition which play a role in
regulating the translation of different mRNAs.

the miRNAs miR-10 and miR-196 are
produced within the HoxB gene cluster
and inhibit the expression of specific genes
within the cluster.

Hence, regulation of transcription/chromatin structure and at a variety
of post-transcriptional levels produces the complex temporal and spatial
patterns of Hox gene expression. Moreover, both long noncoding RNAs and
miRNAs play a role in these processes. As discussed below, the mechanisms
regulating the expression of individual Hox genes are of critical importance
in producing a particular expression pattern, which in turn allows the resulting Hox protein to play a specific role during development.

Differential regulation of different Hox genes by Sonic hedgehog
controls the differentiation of cells in the neural tube
Although the transcriptional and post-transcriptional regulation of Hox
gene expression may appear highly complex, this is necessary in order to
produce specific expression patterns of individual Hox proteins which then
interact to produce different body structures. This is illustrated in the processes that control the differentiation of specific neuronal cells within the
neural tube. This structure, which will form the nervous system, is located
beneath an epidermal layer of ectoderm cells and above the notochord
(see Figure 9.4 for the position of these structures in the gastrula-stage
embryo). The cells in the neural tube respond to signals coming from both
the epidermis and the notochord, so that sensory neurons form in the dorsal part of the neural tube, interneurons form centrally, and motor neurons
form in the ventral portion of the neural tube (Figure 9.59).
In particular, BMP proteins, which are members of the TGFβ family of
signaling proteins (see Chapter 8, Section 8.2) are secreted by the ectoderm
cells overlying the neural tube. In contrast, the Sonic Hedgehog signaling
molecule is secreted by the underlying notochord (see Chapter 8, Section
8.4 for a discussion of signaling by proteins of the Hedgehog family and
Chapter 10, Section 10.1 for the role of notochord-derived Sonic Hedgehog
in muscle formation). In the neural tube, these effects result in a dorsal–
ventral gradient of BMP expression in which levels of BMP are highest dorsally and lowest ventrally. An opposite ventral–dorsal gradient of Sonic
Hedgehog expression exists, with levels being highest ventrally and lowest
dorsally (Figure 9.59).
These gradients differentially affect the expression of different
homeodomain-containing genes so that the gradients are converted into
unique patterns of homeodomain gene expression along the dorsal–ventral

the neural tube is located between the
ectoderm which produces bmP proteins
and the notochord which produces Sonic
Hedgehog (Shh). It is therefore subjected
to opposite concentration gradients in
the levels of Sonic Hedgehog (which is
highest ventrally) and bmP (which is highest
dorsally).

axis of the neural tube. Although all the genes are activated by BMP proteins, they differ in their response to Sonic Hedgehog. Thus, expression of
the homeodomain-containing genes encoding Pax6, Pax7, Dbx1, Dbx2,
and Irx3 is repressed by Sonic Hedgehog. However, their sensitivity to such
repression differs so that Pax7 is the most sensitive to repression followed
by Dbx1, Dbx2, Irx3, and finally Pax6, which is the least sensitive to repression. Hence, Pax6 is repressed only at much higher levels of Sonic Hedgehog
than Pax7 and is therefore expressed more ventrally in the neural tube
(Figure 9.60).
In contrast, the genes encoding the homeodomain factors Nkx6.1 and
Nkx2.2 are activated by Sonic Hedgehog, with Nkx6.1 being more sensitive
to activation and so being expressed at a lower level of Sonic Hedgehog
than Nkx2.2 (Figure 9.60). These different effects on the expression of different homeodomain-containing proteins result in each region having a unique
pattern of expression of the different homeodomain genes, which in turn
results in the formation of different neuronal cell types in the different
regions (Figure 9.60).
Interestingly, the boundaries of expression between the different regions
are sharpened by mutually antagonistic effects of individual transcription
factors on expression of each other. Thus, Nkx2.2 represses the expression
of Pax6 and vice versa, so producing a tight boundary of expression between
regions five and six. Similarly, Nkx6.1 and Dbx2 each repress expression of

Regulation of Hox gene expression by Sonic hedgehog is also
involved in limb formation
Sonic Hedgehog also plays a critical role in the development of the limbs.
Each limb initially forms as a limb bud which grows out of the side of the
embryo. The sonic hedgehog gene is activated in the posterior region of the
bud by the growth factor FGF8. Such specific activation is dependent on an
enhancer element which is located approximately 1 million bases away
from the sonic hedgehog transcription unit. Although enhancers are frequently located at great distances from the genes they regulate (see Chapter
4, Section 4.4), this is the most distant enhancer yet identified. Indeed, it was
only located on the basis that mutations in this region were identified in
human families with inherited polydactyly (multiple digits) (Figure 9.62)
(see also Chapter 12, Section 12.1). These findings therefore indicate the
importance of the correct regulation of sonic hedgehog gene expression in
limb development, as well as indicating the vast distances over which
enhancers can act.
Within the developing limb bud, the Sonic Hedgehog protein activates
expression of the HoxD11, D12, and D13 genes, which in turn stimulate further transcription of the sonic hedgehog gene. This results in high levels of
expression of sonic hedgehog and the HoxD11–13 genes in the posterior and
not the anterior part of the limb bud (Figure 9.63).
Sonic Hedgehog produces its effects via the GCR which regulates the
HoxD cluster (see above, Figure 9.55). It therefore activates the gene closest
to the GCR (HoxD13) most strongly and so on. Hence, HoxD13 is expressed
most strongly and most anteriorly in the limb bud, followed by HoxD12 and
so on (Figure 9.64). As in other examples we have discussed, this effect
therefore produces distinct expression patterns of the different HoxD genes,
allowing them to contribute to the development of the limb and its associated digits.

FIgURe 9.62
the activation of sonic hedgehog (Shh) gene expression in the limb bud
by FGF8 is produced by an enhancer element (E) located approximately
1 million bases from the sonic hedgehog transcription unit. mutations in
this enhancer result in polydactyly (multiple digits) in humans.

FIgURe 9.64
Activation of HoxD gene expression in the limb by Sonic Hedgehog occurs
via the general control region (GCR). this results in the strength of gene
activation being related to the location of the Hox gene relative to the GCR
(a). In turn, this results in expression of the gene closest to the GCR (HoxD13)
being the strongest and extending most anteriorly in the limb bud (b).

Interestingly, the miRNAs which are produced from within Hox gene
clusters, as described above (see Figure 9.57) appear to play a key role in
ensuring the correct pattern of Hox gene expression in the developing limbs.
Thus, it has been shown that retinoic acid normally induces expression of
the HoxB8 gene in the chick forelimb and in turn HoxB8 then activates the
sonic hedgehog gene. This process does not occur in the hind limb, even if
excess retinoic acid is added. This is because the miRNA, miR-196, acts to
repress HoxB8 expression in the hind limb even if it is artificially stimulated
with retinoic acid (Figure 9.65). This suggests that miRNAs can act as a
fail-safe mechanism, blocking inappropriate Hox gene transcription by
repressing gene expression at a post-transcriptional level. This is clearly of
particular importance due to the dramatic effects of the Hox proteins, so
rendering any inappropriate expression in the wrong place within the
embryo highly damaging and likely to produce an abnormal embryo.
Taken together therefore, the studies described in this section indicate
that in vertebrates such as mammals, as in Drosophila, homeodomaincontaining transcription factors play a key role in the development of many
different structures within the embryo. A variety of transcriptional and
post-transcriptional processes regulate the expression of these genes,
ensuring that the corresponding proteins exert their powerful effects on target gene expression only at the appropriate place and appropriate time during embryonic development.

CONCLUSIONS
In this chapter we have discussed how a range of gene regulatory mechanisms operate during development to ensure that a wide variety of different
body structures are formed at the correct place and at the correct time.
Some of these processes involve post-transcriptional regulation, such as the
translational control of maternal mRNA which operates before and after
fertilization, or the processes which regulate the localization of the Bicoid
mRNA in the early Drosophila embryo. Similarly, as in many other systems
discussed in previous chapters, miRNAs play a key role in regulating gene
expression at post-transcriptional levels. In particular, such miRNAs can
serve as a fail-safe device, ensuring that any aberrant transcription of a
gene encoding a regulatory protein does not result in the production of that
protein in the wrong place or at the wrong time, which would produce
undesirable effects on embryonic development.
Despite these examples of post-transcriptional control, however, it is
clear that specific transcription factors play a key role in all stages of

embryonic development by regulating their downstream target genes at the
transcriptional level. For example, as discussed in Section 9.1, transcription
factors such as Oct4 are specifically expressed in pluripotent ES cells and
the expression of a cocktail of transcription factors in differentiated fibroblast cells can convert them into a pluripotent ES-like state. These factors
play a key role in allowing ES cells to maintain their pluripotent nature
through many cell divisions, while also being poised to differentiate into
specific cell types.
Individually or in combination, these factors can activate the expression of
target genes whose protein products are required in undifferentiated ES cells
while repressing target genes whose protein products are only required in
differentiated cells. The effect of these factors is enhanced, however, by their
ability to modulate the expression of genes encoding regulatory proteins
(such as other transcription factors or proteins which modulate chromatin
structure) and of the genes encoding miRNAs or long regulatory RNAs such as
XIST. In these cases the transcription factors modulate the synthesis of proteins and RNAs which themselves regulate the expression of a number of
other genes, so producing a cascade effect on gene expression (Figure 9.66).
In many instances, Oct4 and the other ES cell-specific transcription factors act together to produce specific effects on gene expression. This combinatorial effect of transcription factors is also seen later in embryonic
development. As described in Section 9.2, a cascade of transcription factor
regulation is initiated by the gradient of the Bicoid protein in the syncytial
Drosophila embryo. This ultimately results in different levels of the transcription factors Bicoid, Hunchback, Giant, and Kruppel within different
regions of the developing embryo. These factors then act either positively or
negatively on the transcription of the Eve gene, thereby converting a simple
gradient in Bicoid protein levels into a band or stripe of Eve gene expression
which defines a specific segment of the developing Drosophila.
Similarly, as discussed in Section 9.3, Sonic Hedgehog has different
effects on the expression of specific homeodomain-containing transcription
factors with different concentrations of Sonic Hedgehog being required to
activate or repress the expression of different factors. In turn, this results in
the gradient of Sonic Hedgehog expression across the neural tube being
translated into a code whereby each region of the neural tube has a unique
pattern of transcription factor expression. This allows different types of neuronal cells to differentiate at different points in the neural tube.
Hence, the regulated synthesis of transcription factors plays a critical
role in embryonic development, contrasting with the critical role of transcription factor activation in the response to cellular signaling pathways
which was discussed in Chapter 8. Moreover, the ability of transcription
factors to interact with one another and to regulate the expression of other
regulatory proteins and RNAs produces complex regulatory networks, which
are now being progressively defined and shown to be critical for embryonic
development (Figure 9.67).

factor gene expression and in turn allow the production of specific morphological structures during embryonic development. In turn, such structures
will contain specific cell types that will perform particular functions in both
the embryo and the adult. The processes regulating cell type-specific gene
expression which allow these different cell types to fulfill their different
functions will be discussed in the next chapter.

Control of Cell Type-Specific
Gene Expression
INTRODUCTION
As discussed in Chapter 9, the regulation of gene expression plays a key role
in the early development of organisms as diverse as flies and mammals. In
many cases, such regulation involves transcription factors whose synthesis
is regulated so that they are only produced at a particular time during development or in a particular region of the embryo. For example, the Oct4 factor
is synthesized specifically in pluripotent cells of the early embryo and is
important in maintaining their pluripotent nature (see Chapter 9, Section
9.1). Similarly, in both Drosophila and mammals, homeodomain-containing
transcription factors are synthesized in particular regions of the embryo and
control the production of different embryonic structures (see Chapter 9,
Sections 9.2 and 9.3).
Ultimately, embryonic development results in the production of the different tissues and organs of the adult organism, each of which contains
specific differentiated cell types. As is the case in early development, the
production and maintenance of such differentiated cells is controlled by
specific transcription factors which are synthesized specifically in that cell
type. Many of these differentiated cells must function in the body for considerable periods of time and in some cases individual differentiated cells may
persist for the entire lifetime of the organism. This clearly requires the transcription factors involved to regulate transcription over prolonged periods.
This explains why such cell type-specific transcription factors are primarily
regulated by controlling their synthesis rather than by the regulation of their
activity, which as described in Chapter 8 is primarily used to provide a rapid
response to cellular signaling pathways.
Regulation of transcription factor synthesis is used, for example, in the
case of the C/EBPα transcription factor which is produced primarily in the
liver. In this case, the actual transcription of the C/EBPα gene occurs in a
small number of tissues such as the liver, so that C/EBPα is not synthesized in other tissues. This allows C/EBPα to activate the expression of a
number of tissue-specific genes, such as transthyretin and α-1-antitrypsin.
The regulated transcription of the C/EBPα gene controls the production of
the corresponding protein which in turn directly controls the tissuespecific transcription of other genes. Interestingly, once regulated transcription has occurred, the use of alternative translational initiation codons
then allows the production of different forms of C/EBPα with different
activities to occur (see Chapter 7, Section 7.6).
Similarly, in the case of B lymphocytes, cell type-specific gene expression involves the synthesis of the Oct2 transcription factor which is
produced in B lymphocytes and not in most other cell types. This factor regulates the expression of a number of B-cell-specific genes such as CD36 and
the cysteine-rich secretory protein-3 (CRISP-3). Moreover, inactivation of

the gene encoding Oct2 in mice results in defects in B-lymphocyte maturation, indicating the essential role of this transcription factor in the production of mature B cells.
Interestingly however, B-cell-specific gene expression also involves the
regulation of transcription factor activity as well as of transcription factor
synthesis. Thus, the transcription factor NFκB regulates the B-cell-specific
expression of the immunoglobulin κ light-chain gene. Immunoglobulin κ
gene expression is activated when pre-B cells differentiate into mature B
lymphocytes which produce immunoglobulin. During B-cell differentiation,
NFκB is activated by the dissociation of the inhibitory IκB protein from the
NFκB/IκB complex, releasing mature NFκB which activates immunoglobulin
κ light-chain gene expression. This parallels the mechanism used to activate NFκB in a wide variety of cell types following exposure to signals such
as tumor necrosis factor α or interleukin-1 (see Chapter 8, Section 8.2). Of
course, the immunoglobulin κ light-chain gene is not activated in these
other cell types, since it will be in a tightly packed chromatin configuration
and will not have undergone the DNA rearrangement which occurs in the
B-cell lineage (see Chapter 1, Section 1.3).
Hence, the activation of a specific transcription factor, such as NFκB,
from a preexisting inactive form can play a role in cell type-specific gene
expression as well as in the activation of gene expression in response to
specific cellular signals (Figure 10.1). Moreover, gene expression in B lymphocytes combines the cell type-specific synthesis of the Oct2 transcription
factor with the cell type-specific activation of the NFκB transcription factor
(Figure 10.2).
In this chapter, we discuss in detail three examples of the cell typespecific regulation of gene expression and the manner in which gene
expression is regulated at the level of transcription by specific transcription

factors as well as by post-transcriptional regulation. Section 10.1 will discuss the regulation of cell type-specific gene expression in skeletal muscle
cells where early studies identified a master regulatory transcription
factor. This transcription factor, MyoD, is a member of the basic helix-loophelix family (see Chapter 5, Section 5.1) and is synthesized only in skeletal
muscle cells.
Similarly, Section 10.2 will discuss gene regulation at both transcriptional and post-transcriptional levels in neuronal cells. At the transcriptional level, this involves both positively acting basic helix-loop-helix
transcription factors and a loss of expression of the repressor element
silencing transcription factor (REST), which is expressed in nonneuronal
cells and is able to repress the expression of neuron-specific genes. As will
be discussed, REST expression in neuronal cells is inhibited by specific
miRNAs, which also regulate the expression of factors involved in regulating alternative splicing in neuronal and nonneuronal cells.
Lastly, Section 10.3 will discuss the regulation of the yeast mating-type
system where transcription factors control the production of two mating
types, a and α. This system is not only of interest in itself as a well analyzed
example of cell-type specific gene expression in a unicellular eukaryote, but
also provides insights into the complex problem of gene regulation in cellular differentiation in multicellular organisms.

The MyoD protein can induce muscle cell differentiation
As described in the Introduction to Chapter 9, the process of gastrulation
results in the formation of three layers in the embryo, the inner endoderm,
the central mesoderm, and the outer ectoderm. These three germ layers will
each give rise to specific tissues of the later embryo and ultimately of the
adult organism.
This section will consider the formation of skeletal muscle, which is
formed from undifferentiated mesoderm cells in a two-stage process
(Figure 10.3). In the first stage, undifferentiated mesoderm cells form
muscle precursor cells, known as myoblasts. The myoblasts continue to
proliferate but eventually a number of myoblasts fuse together to form a
multinucleate nondividing differentiated muscle cell, which is known as a
myotube (Figure 10.3).
A key role in elucidating how this process is regulated was played by the
observation (discussed in Chapter 3, Section 3.2) that the fibroblast 10T½
cell line could be induced to differentiate into muscle cells by treatment
with the nucleoside 5-azacytidine. As discussed in Chapter 3 (Section 3.2),
5-azacytidine induces the demethylation of C residues in the DNA, resulting
in the activation of gene expression. This experiment therefore provided
important evidence for the role of methylation of C residues in the regulation of chromatin structure and therefore gene transcription.
On the basis of this experiment, it was proposed that 5-azacytidine
induces the demethylation of one or more key regulatory genes in the 10T½
cells, thereby activating their expression and in turn activating numerous
other genes whose expression is dependent upon expression of the key regulatory gene(s) (Figure 10.4).
Evidently, such a master regulatory gene should show greatly increased
expression when 10T½ cells are induced to differentiate into myoblast cells.
To try and isolate the gene encoding this regulatory factor, a subtractive
hybridization experiment was therefore performed. In this procedure
(Figure 10.5) total mRNA prepared from the muscle cells was exposed to
subtractive hybridization to remove all the mRNAs which were also
expressed in undifferentiated 10T½ cells, therefore leaving only the small
number of mRNAs which were specifically expressed in the differentiated
cells. Further subtractive hybridization steps were then performed to
remove RNAs such as that encoding myosin which were characteristic of

terminally differentiated muscle cells and others which are induced by
5-azacytidine treatment in all cell types and therefore cannot include the
regulatory gene which specifically induces muscle differentiation.
The remaining sample, which should contain the mRNA derived from
the regulatory gene locus, was then used to screen a cDNA library prepared
from 10T½ cells. This procedure resulted in the isolation of three genes,
named MyoA, MyoD, and MyoH, whose expression was specifically activated
when 10T½ cells were induced to form muscle cells by treatment with
5-azacytidine. These genes therefore represent potential candidates for the
master regulatory gene. When these genes were introduced individually
into untreated 10T½ cells to determine whether their overexpression could
actually induce muscle cell differentiation, no muscle cell differentiation
was observed upon overexpression of either MyoA or MyoH. However, overexpression of MyoD was able to induce muscle cell differentiation in 10T½
cells exactly as occurs upon differentiation with 5-azacytidine. This identified MyoD as a master regulatory factor that can induce muscle cell differentiation when it is artificially overexpressed or where expression of the
endogenous gene encoding MyoD is induced by treating 10T½ cells with
5-azacytidine.

MyoD is a basic helix-loop-helix transcription factor
which is able to regulate gene expression
The overexpression of MyoD is able to activate a number of musclespecific genes such as those encoding myosin heavy and light chains,
M-cadherin, and muscle creatine kinase (Figure 10.6a). In addition, MyoD
overexpression in 10T½ cells induces the expression of MyoA and MyoH
(Figure 10.6b), the other two genes whose expression was shown to be
specifically induced by 5-azacytidine in 10T½ cells but which did not themselves induce differentiation when overexpressed (see above).
These findings indicated that MyoD was likely to be a transcription factor
whose overexpression induces the expression of muscle-specific genes
(Figure 10.6). Indeed, analysis of the structure of MyoD revealed it to be a
basic helix-loop-helix transcription factor containing a basic DNA-binding
domain and adjacent helix-loop-helix dimerization domain (see Chapter 5,
Section 5.1 for a discussion of these motifs) together with an N-terminal
activation domain (see Chapter 5, Section 5.2 for discussion of transcription
factor activation domains) (Figure 10.7).
As well as activating muscle-specific genes, MyoD can also modulate
gene expression to inhibit cellular proliferation, thereby producing the
FIgURe 10.5
experimental procedure used to isolate the gene encoding the master
regulatory protein. rNA prepared from differentiated 10T½ cells was
converted to cDNA and subtractive hybridization was used to remove
mrNAs expressed in undifferentiated 10T½ cells or those characteristic of
terminal muscle differentiation or those which are induced in all cells by
5-azacytidine. The remaining cDNA was used to screen a cDNA library to
isolate genes which are specifically induced in 10T½ cells by 5-azacytidine.
This resulted in the isolation of cDNA clones derived from the genes
encoding MyoA, MyoD, and MyoH.

MyoD can induce expression of a variety of different genes including
muscle-specific genes (a), MyoA and MyoH, the other two genes isolated
as being specifically induced by 5-azacytidine in 10T½ cells (b), growth
arrest genes such as p21 (c), and the gene encoding MyoD itself (d).

nondividing phenotype characteristic of differentiated muscle cells. For
example, MyoD activates the gene encoding the p21 inhibitor of cyclindependent kinases (Figure 10.6c) (see Chapter 11, Section 11.3 for a
discussion of p21). This will therefore result in the enhanced expression of
p21, so inhibiting the cyclin-dependent kinases whose activity is necessary
for cellular proliferation.
Interestingly, MyoD also activates expression of its own gene so that, for
example, when MyoD is artificially overexpressed in 10T½ cells, it activates
the endogenous MyoD gene, further enhancing MyoD levels (Figure 10.6d).
This indicates that a positive feedback loop exists which will maintain high
levels of MyoD expression and promote stable commitment to the muscle
cell lineage once MyoD is initially expressed (Figure 10.8).
As a DNA-binding transcription factor, MyoD achieves its effect by binding to specific target sequences known as E boxes in the regulatory regions
of muscle-specific genes, activating their expression. High-affinity binding
requires MyoD to form a heterodimer with other members of the basic helixloop-helix family, such as the E12 and E47 factors, which are ubiquitously
expressed in all cell types. Hence, the DNA-binding heterodimer consists of
one molecule of the muscle-specific MyoD and one molecule of the ubiquitously expressed basic helix-loop-helix E proteins.
As is the case for many other DNA-binding transcription factors, MyoD
achieves its effects on gene expression by interacting with co-activator molecules which can then interact with components of the basal transcription
complex (see Chapter 5, Section 5.2). One such target for MyoD is the TAF3
(TBP-associated factor 3) co-activator. Interestingly however, in differentiated muscle cells rather than interacting with TBP itself, TAF3 interacts with
TRF3, a TBP-like factor that substitutes for TBP in such cells (see Chapter 4,
Section 4.1). Hence, differentiated muscle cells will have a specific gene activation complex containing MyoD, TAF3, and TRF3 (Figure 10.9).
As well as interacting with TAF3, MyoD can also bind the p300 transcriptional co-activator (see Chapter 5, Section 5.2). Like its close relative CBP,
p300 has histone acetyltransferase activity allowing it to open up the chromatin of target genes, as well as interacting with the basal transcriptional
complex to stimulate their transcription (see Chapter 5, Section 5.2 for discussion of the effects of co-activators on gene expression). Hence, MyoD,
via p300, can influence both chromatin structure and gene transcription
(Figure 10.10).
Moreover, MyoD can also recruit the SWI/SNF chromatin remodeling
complex (see Chapter 3, Section 3.5) to muscle-specific genes, allowing
MyoD to open the chromatin by this means as well as via histone acetylation. Thus, it has been shown that MyoD interacts with the BAF60c protein
and the complex of the two proteins then binds to the promoters of musclespecific genes (Figure 10.11a). BAF60c is normally a component of the
SWI/SNF complex and so its binding to muscle-specific genes together with
MyoD results in the recruitment of the remainder of the SWI/SNF complex,
resulting in opening of the chromatin and muscle-specific gene expression
(Figure 10.11b).

The MyoD transcription factor associates both with the SWI/SNF
chromatin unwinding complex and with the p300 transcriptional
co-activator, which has histone acetyltransferase activity and can
also stimulate activity of the basal transcriptional complex (BTC).
Binding of MyoD therefore promotes the transition of inactive closed
chromatin to the active open state and also enhances transcription
of its target genes by the basal transcriptional complex.

Transcription

These chromatin-remodeling activities are of particular importance
since they will allow MyoD to stimulate its target genes and induce the
development of muscle cells from undifferentiated precursors in which
muscle-specific genes may be in the tightly packed condensed chromatin
structure characteristic of inactive genes.

MyoD is regulated by controlling both its synthesis and
its activity
Taken together therefore, the findings discussed above indicate that MyoD
is a master regulator of muscle-specific gene expression and differentiation
whose expression results in the production of differentiated muscle cells. In
agreement with this, MyoD mRNA and protein are present in skeletal muscle tissue taken from a number of different sites in the body but are absent
in all other tissues. Hence, MyoD represents a transcription factor that is
controlled at the level of its synthesis, with such regulation playing a key
role in muscle cell differentiation.
Interestingly however, MyoD is not regulated solely at the level of synthesis. Overexpression of MyoD in undifferentiated 10T½ cells or its activation with 5-azacytidine converts the fibroblast cells into myoblasts rather
than into fully differentiated multinucleate myotubes. Production of fully
differentiated myotubes from the myoblasts in cell culture systems also
requires the removal of serum (Figure 10.12).
Paradoxically MyoD levels do not increase in the transition from myoblasts to myotubes. The explanation of this paradox is provided by the existence of an inhibitory molecule, known as Id, which binds to MyoD to form
a MyoD/Id heterodimer (see Chapter 5, Section 5.3 and Figure 5.34). As Id
has a helix-loop-helix domain but no basic DNA-binding domain, the
MyoD/Id heterodimer cannot bind to DNA.
Upon removal of serum, Id levels decrease and MyoD is free to form a
DNA-binding heterodimer with proteins such as E12 or E47, which have
both a helix-loop-helix motif and a functional DNA-binding domain. This
results in the activation of MyoD target genes and full muscle differentiation
(Figure 10.12). Thus, MyoD is a transcription factor which is controlled both
at the level of synthesis and at the level of regulation of its activity by interaction with an inhibitory protein.
Interestingly, the interaction of MyoD with SWI/SNF (see above and
Figure 10.11) is also regulated in the myoblast to myotube transition. Thus,
the MyoD/BAF60c complex binds to muscle-specific genes in myoblasts.

Undifferentiated 10T½ cells do not express MyoD. Myoblast muscle
cell precursors do express MyoD but muscle-specific genes (M) are
not activated because MyoD forms an inactive heterodimer with the
Id factor. When cells are induced to form differentiated myotubes by
removal of growth factors, Id levels decline. MyoD can then form an
active DNA-binding heterodimer with ubiquitously expressed e
box-binding members of the helix-loop-helix family of transcription
factors (e). Transcription of muscle-specific genes is therefore activated.

This only occurs during differentiation to form myotubes, so ensuring that
muscle-specific genes are only activated in fully differentiated myotubes
(Figure 10.11). Hence, the regulation of MyoD synthesis and the interaction
of MyoD with other regulatory proteins allows it to play a key role in the
differentiation of skeletal muscle cells and the activation of the genes
expressed specifically in this cell type.

Other muscle-specific transcription factors can induce muscle

From the data discussed above, MyoD fulfils all the requirements of a master regulator of skeletal muscle cell differentiation. It is expressed specifically in skeletal muscle, it can induce the expression of muscle-specific
genes, and most importantly, its overexpression in nonmuscle cells in culture can induce them to form differentiated muscle cells.
If MyoD were indeed the sole master regulator of skeletal muscle differentiation, the inactivation of the gene encoding MyoD in knockout mice
should result in the absence of skeletal muscle. In fact however, this is not
the case; mice lacking MyoD exhibit generally normal muscle development
and are viable and fertile, although there is some delay in the formation of
some muscles such as the early limb muscles (Figure 10.13).

Chapter 10: Control of Cell Type-Specific Gene Expression

This effect occurs because there are three other genes encoding muscle
regulatory factors in addition to MyoD. The three genes encode the proteins
Myf5, Myogenin, and Mrf4. These proteins are closely related to MyoD and
are all basic helix-loop-helix transcription factors. Most importantly, like
MyoD, each of these three genes when overexpressed individually in 10T½
cells is able to induce the formation of differentiated muscle cells.
When the gene encoding Myf5 is inactivated in knockout mice, the
majority of skeletal muscle develops relatively normally, although as with
MyoD there are some muscle defects, in this case defects in trunk skeletal
muscle (Figure 10.13). However, when both MyoD and Myf5 are inactivated
in double knockout mice, the mice fail to form skeletal muscle myoblasts
and therefore do not produce skeletal muscle (Figure 10.13). Hence, in single knockout mice, MyoD and Myf5 can apparently substitute for one
another so that the mice produce skeletal muscle. However, when both factors are absent skeletal muscle does not form (Figure 10.14).
Detailed analysis of the phenotypes of knockout mice for each of the
four muscle regulatory genes has suggested that myogenin acts later than
the other three factors. As noted above, in embryonic development, mesoderm cells in regions known as the myotome first differentiate into
myoblast cells, paralleling the first stage of 10T½ cell differentiation.
Subsequently, the myoblasts fuse together to form multinucleate fully differentiated myotubes. It is likely that MyoD and Myf5 act at the first stage
of this process, inducing commitment to the muscle cell lineage, whereas
myogenin is required for the second stage of full differentiation and Mrf4
may act at both stages (Figure 10.15).
In the whole animal, there is a complex relationship between the four
muscle regulatory factors, with the protein product of each gene being able
to activate the expression of other members of the muscle regulatory gene
family, as well as of downstream genes whose protein products are required
in muscle cells. Figure 10.16 shows the inter-relationships between the
four different muscle-determining genes in the myotome, which is the name
given to the mesodermal regions that give rise to skeletal muscle.
As illustrated in Figure 10.16, a complex relationship exists between the
four different muscle-determining genes and this relationship differs in different parts of the embryonic myotome which give rise to different skeletal
muscles in the adult organism. Interestingly, as shown in Figure 10.16, Myf5
is the first gene in the hierarchy of expression in the epaxial myotome and
can induce the expression of myogenin and Mrf4 in this region. This correlates with the defects in trunk muscle observed in Myf5 single knockout
mice since these muscles form from the epaxial myotome. In contrast,
MyoD is responsible for inducing myogenin and Mrf4 expression in hypaxial
myotome. Since this region of the myotome gives rise to the limb muscles,
this correlates with the defect in limb muscle formation observed in MyoD
single knockout mice.
Evidently, the cascade of expression of multiple muscle regulatory genes
illustrated in Figure 10.16 must be initiated by other factors which activate
expression of the first gene in the hierarchy. In agreement with this, it has
been shown that MyoD expression can be activated by the Pax3 transcription factor which contains a homeodomain as well as another DNA-binding
domain, known as the paired domain (see Chapter 5, Section 5.1). Similarly,
expression of Myf5 in the epaxial myotome is initiated by the signaling molecules Wnt and Sonic Hedgehog (which is a member of the Hedgehog signaling molecule family, see Chapter 8, Section 8.4 and Chapter 9, Section 9.3).
These factors are derived, respectively, from the neural tube and notochord,
which are adjacent to the myotome (Figure 10.16).
Interestingly, expression of MyoD is also regulated by a long noncoding
RNA, as well as by transcription factors. As with many enhancers (see

Chapter 4, Section 4.4), an enhancer located approximately 20 kb from the

DNA looping, opens the chromatin around the MyoD promoter allowing
access for activating transcription factors and RNA polymerase itself
(Figure 10.17).
The studies described in this section therefore build on the initial identification of MyoD as a master regulatory gene for skeletal muscle cell and
differentiation and show that in fact four such regulatory genes exist, which
interact with one another to activate skeletal muscle-specific gene expression in the whole animal.

The four regulatory proteins described above, MyoD, Myf5, myogenin, and

genes which encode protein products required specifically in muscle cells.
In addition however, each of these four muscle regulatory genes is able to
activate the expression of genes encoding the MEF2 (myocyte enhancer
factor 2) family of regulatory proteins. Four different MEF2 proteins exist,
known as MEF2 A–D. In contrast to MyoD and the other three factors, the

Chapter 10: Control of Cell Type-Specific Gene Expression

MEF2 proteins are not basic helix-loop-helix family transcription factors but
belong to the MADS family of transcription factors which is named after its
founder members, MCM1 (see Section 10.3), agamous, deficiens, and serum
response factor (see Chapter 8, Section 8.2).
Moreover, unlike MyoD, Myf5, myogenin and Mrf4, overexpression of
MEF2 proteins alone cannot induce 10T½ cells to differentiate into muscle
cells. Nonetheless, MEF2 proteins play a critical role in muscle cell-specific
gene expression. The muscle master regulatory genes induce expression of
MEF2 proteins, which then co-operate with the master regulatory gene
products to induce the expression of genes characteristic of differentiated
muscle cells (Figure 10.18). Indeed, many muscle-specific genes contain
in their regulatory regions E box-binding sites for factors such as MyoD,
adjacent to binding sites for MEF2 proteins. The muscle regulatory proteins
and MEF2 proteins are likely therefore to bind to these adjacent sites and
interact with one another to stimulate muscle-specific gene expression
(Figure 10.19).
Indeed, MyoD interacts directly with MEF2 proteins via a protein–protein
interaction and this interaction appears to be of importance in allowing
MyoD to activate muscle-specific gene expression. As well as mediating
DNA binding, the basic domain of MyoD also mediates its interaction with
MEF2 and three amino acids in this domain have been shown to be particularly critical for this interaction. Alteration of these three amino acids to
their equivalents in the basic domain of the E12 ubiquitously expressed
transcription factor results in a hybrid protein which cannot interact with
MEF2 or activate muscle-specific gene expression even though it can still
bind to the E box DNA-binding sites (Figure 10.20). In contrast, a hybrid
basic domain containing the three key amino acids from MyoD but with the
remaining portion derived from E12 can both bind to MEF2 and activate
muscle-specific gene expression (Figure 10.20).
As well as co-operating to induce genes involved in the terminal differentiation of muscle cells, MyoD and MEF2 proteins also co-operate to activate the genes encoding two miRNAs, miR-1 and miR-133 (Figure 10.21).
As with the other miRNAs discussed in previous chapters, miR-1 and miR133 inhibit gene expression, turning off genes not required in muscle cells.
Interestingly however, these miRNAs also target genes encoding regulatory proteins. For example, miR-1 inhibits the expression of the gene
encoding histone deacetylase 4 (HDAC4). HDAC4 can associate with MEF2
and prevent it from activating its target genes by maintaining them in an
inactive chromatin structure. Inhibiting HDAC4 expression therefore
results in activation of MEF2 in a manner paralleling the activation of
MEF2 by phosphorylation of histone deacetylases which was discussed in
Chapters 3 (Section 3.3) and 8 (Section 8.5). Hence, the ability of MEF2 to
activate gene expression in muscle differentiation can be regulated both by
inhibiting the synthesis of histone deacetylases that associate with MEF2
or by HDAC phosphorylation promoting dissociation from MEF2 and export
from the nucleus (Figure 10.22).
Interestingly, miR-133 can also bind to the mRNA encoding MEF2C itself
and inhibit its expression, providing a negative feedback loop regulating
MEF2C expression (Figure 10.23a). This regulatory loop is itself modulated by a long noncoding RNA, MD1, which is only expressed in

MyoD and other muscle regulatory gene

The basic DNA-binding domain of MyoD can mediate DNA binding,
muscle-specific gene activation, and interaction with MeF2. In contrast,
the basic domain of the e12 factor can bind to DNA but does not produce
muscle-specific gene activation or interact with MeF2. These differences
are dependent on three amino acids at positions 114, 115, and 124 in
MyoD. Thus a hybrid protein (M/e) with these three amino acids from MyoD
but the remaining basic domain from e12 can activate muscle-specific
gene expression and interact with MeF2. In contrast, this is not the case
for a hybrid protein (e/M) which contains these amino acids from e12 with
the remaining basic domain derived from MyoD.

Association with histone deacetylase 4 (HDAC4) blocks the ability of

promoting its dissociation from MeF2 and nuclear export (b).

differentiating myoblasts (see Chapter 7, Section 7.7, for discussion of the
role of long noncoding RNAs in regulating miRNA activity). MD1 acts as a
decoy RNA which binds to miR-133, so titrating it away from the MEF2C
mRNA and relieving the negative feedback repression (Figure 10.23b).
In parallel with these effects, miR-1 and miR-133 also reduce the expression of the alternative splicing factor nPTB (neuronal polypyrimidine
tract-binding protein, also known as PTB2). As its name suggests, this protein is highly expressed in neuronal cells (see Section 10.2) but its expression is decreased in muscle cell differentiation by the action of miR-133.
This promotes the inclusion of muscle-specific exons in a variety of transcripts where their inclusion is normally inhibited by high levels of nPTB
(Figure 10.24).
Hence, MyoD and the other muscle regulatory genes can cooperate with
MEF2 proteins both to regulate directly the expression of genes encoding
muscle-specific proteins and to regulate the expression of miRNAs. In turn
these miRNAs regulate the expression of factors involved in transcription
and alternative splicing, as well of genes whose protein products are not
required in muscle cells (Figure 10.25).
Hence MEF2 proteins, acting together with muscle regulatory proteins
such as MyoD, play a key role in muscle-specific gene expression. Unlike
MyoD, or the other muscle regulatory genes, however, overexpression of
MEF2 alone does not induce muscle differentiation in 10T½ cells since it
needs to cooperate with one or other of the muscle regulatory proteins to
induce muscle-specific gene expression. In agreement with this, MEF2 proteins are expressed in a variety of different cell types rather than being

specifically expressed in muscle cells as occurs for MyoD and the other muscle regulatory factors. Rather than being primarily regulated at the level of
its synthesis, MEF2 is in fact primarily regulated by controlling its activity. As
discussed above, this can involve targeting histone deacetylases that associate with MEF2 either by regulating their synthesis or by phosphorylating
them, so promoting their dissociation from MEF2 and their export from the
nucleus (see Figure 10.22).
As well as being affected by phosphorylation of HDAC4, the interaction
of MEF2 proteins with HDACs can also be regulated by phosphorylation of
the MEF2 proteins themselves. Thus, an increase in intracellular cyclic AMP
activates the protein kinase A enzyme (PKA) (see Chapter 8, Section 8.2)
which phosphorylates MEF2 proteins. This converts MEF2 proteins from
transcriptional activators to transcriptional repressors by stimulating their
binding to HDAC4 (Figure 10.26).
A similar conversion of MEF2 to a transcriptional repressor is observed
when the protein is modified by addition of the small protein SUMO,
whereas acetylation of MEF2 promotes its ability to act as a transcriptional
activator (Figure 10.26) (see Chapter 8, Section 8.3, for discussion of these
post-translational modifications of transcription factors).
Muscle differentiation therefore provides examples of the regulation of
transcription factor synthesis and of transcription factor activity. The muscle
regulatory genes, MyoD, Myf5, myogenin, and Mrf4 are synthesized only in
skeletal muscle cells whereas MEF2 proteins are synthesized ubiquitously
and have their activity regulated via post-translational modification and
association with other proteins such as histone deacetylases. Together these
processes regulate the levels and activity of these critical transcription factors and allow them to induce skeletal muscle cell type-specific gene expression at the appropriate time and place.

Basic helix-loop-helix transcription factors are also involved
in neuronal differentiation
Clearly, the brain is the most complex organ in an animal, containing,
for example, many different types of neurons with different functions.
Understanding its differentiation therefore poses unique problems. Moreover, processes such as learning and memory will require an understanding
of how the brain responds to complex stimuli in a manner which affects
subsequent responses. Unfortunately, no simple parallel to the 10T½ system
exists for studying neuronal cell differentiation.
For this reason initial studies of genes encoding transcription factors
involved in neuronal differentiation have used different approaches. One

367

 REGULATION OF GENE EXPRESSION IN NEURONAL CELLS
such approach involved the use of the fruit fly Drosophila which, as discussed
in Chapter 9 (Section 9.2), is genetically well characterized. Initially, strains
of the fly carrying genetic mutations that affected neuronal cell differentiation were isolated. Subsequently, the proteins encoded by the genes that
were mutated in these strains of the fly were identified and characterized.
Unlike muscle cells, neuronal cells arise from ectoderm cells rather than
from mesoderm. Studies in Drosophila have identified several basic helixloop-helix transcription factors involved in inducing undifferentiated ectodermal cells to differentiate into neural precursor cells. Similarly, other basic
helix-loop-helix proteins are involved in inducing the neuronal precursors
to differentiate fully into mature neuronal cells (Figure 10.27). Thus for
example, the Achaete and Scute proteins play a key role in the formation of
neuronal progenitor cells from the initial ectoderm cells, while the Asense
protein is required for the precursor cells to subsequently differentiate into
mature neurons (Figure 10.27).
This system evidently has important parallels with muscle differentiation, discussed in Section 10.1. Thus in the muscle system, Myf5 and MyoD
act to induce undifferentiated mesoderm cells to form myoblasts while
myogenin induces the myoblasts to form myotubes. Although the basic
helix-loop-helix proteins involved in the muscle system differ from those
involved in neuronal cells, the same two-stage process operates, with different basic helix-loop-helix proteins being involved at each of the two
stages (Figure 10.28).
The parallels between the neuronal and muscle systems can be extended
further. Activation of gene expression by Achaete and Scute involves heterodimerization with the ubiquitously expressed Da protein (Figure 10.28)
paralleling the role of the ubiquitously expressed E12/E47 proteins in the
muscle system. Similarly, activation of gene expression by Achaete and
Scute is inhibited by a protein known as Emc, which contains a helix-loophelix motif but lacks the basic binding domain. It therefore acts in the same
negative manner as the Id protein discussed in Section 10.1 (Figure 10.28).
Interestingly, the ectodermal cells that will eventually form neurons in
Drosophila exist as a single layer of cells in which some cells will differentiate to produce nerve cells whereas other adjacent cells will differentiate to
produce epidermal cells. This process is controlled by the Notch/Delta signaling pathway which, as discussed in Chapter 8 (Section 8.4) mediates signaling between adjacent cells.
Initially, all cells in the ectodermal layer will express low levels of the
Achaete and Scute proteins. Differentiation is initiated when an individual
cell (cell 1 in Figure 10.29) in the ectodermal layer randomly begins to
produce more Achaete and Scute proteins than an adjacent cell (cell 2 in
Figure 10.29). Increased expression of these proteins results in transcriptional activation of the gene encoding the Delta protein leading to increased
levels of this protein in the membrane of cell 1 (Figure 10.29). In turn, as
described in Chapter 8 (Section 8.4). The Delta protein activates the Notch
receptor on adjacent cells, such as cell 2 in Figure 10.29. Interestingly, such
activation results in down-regulation of the genes encoding Achaete and
Scute in cell 2, enhancing the initial difference in expression between the
two cells. In turn, the reduced Achaete/Scute expression in cell 2 results in

FIgURe 10.28
parallels between the vertebrate muscle differentiation pathway and
the Drosophila neuronal differentiation pathway. The role of the musclespecific basic helix-loop-helix domain proteins Myf5, MyoD, and myogenin
in different stages of muscle differentiation is paralleled by the roles of
Achaete (Ac), Scute (Sc), and Asense, respectively, in different stages of
neuronal differentiation. In both situations the cell type-specific proteins
heterodimerize with ubiquitously expressed basic helix-loop-helix proteins,
e12/e47 in the vertebrate muscle system and Da in the Drosophila nerve cell
system. Similarly, in each case, DNA binding is inhibited by a helix-loop-helix
protein which lacks a DNA-binding domain, Id in the case of the vertebrate
muscle system and emc in the Drosophila neuronal system.

A small increase in the level of Achaete and/or Scute
in cell 1 compared to cell 2 will result in Achaete/Scute
activating the Delta gene in cell 1. In turn, the resulting
Delta protein will signal to the Notch receptor in cell
2, which will inhibit Achaete/Scute expression in cell 2
(a). This results in an enhanced difference in Achaete/
Scute levels between cell 1 and cell 2, which is further
enhanced since the reduced levels of Achaete/Scute in
cell 2 will down-regulate the Delta protein in cell 2 (light
pink). In turn, this will result in the Notch receptor not
being activated in cell 1, so preventing any repression of
Achaete/Scute expression in this cell (b). This feedback
loop will result in cell 1 having high levels of Achaete,
Scute, and Delta together with inactive Notch, whereas
cell 2 will have low levels of Achaete, Scute, and Delta
together with active Notch (c). In turn, this will result
in cell 1 differentiating along the neuronal pathway
whereas the adjacent cell 2 will differentiate along the
epidermal pathway (d).

decreased levels of Delta expression in cell 2 (Figure 10.29). This has the
effect of preventing Delta in cell 2 from activating Notch in cell 1 and so
prevents any inhibitory effect of Notch on the increasing levels of Achaete
and Scute in cell 1 (Figure 10.29).
The overall process therefore results in cell 1 having a high level of
Achaete, Scute, and Delta but a low level of Notch activation. In contrast,
cell 2 has a low level of Achaete, Scute, and Delta but a high level of Notch
activation. This results in cell 1 developing into a neuronal progenitor with
target genes activated by Achaete and Scute, whereas cell 2 differentiates
into an epidermal cell due to the low levels of Achaete and Scute. This process is known as lateral inhibition in which one cell not only differentiates
into a particular cell type but also prevents its neighbor from doing so.
In this manner, it is possible to see how regulatory processes can not
only produce the pattern of gene expression characteristic of a particular
cell but ensure that this occurs in the appropriate place relative to other
differentiated cells (Figure 10.30). A similar process operates in the first
differentiation event in the mammalian embryo which produces trophectoderm and inner cell mass cells. As discussed in Chapter 9 (Introduction), this
involves elevated levels of the Oct4 transcription factor in the inner cell
mass cells repressing expression of the Cdx2 transcription factor, whereas
the opposite effect occurs in the trophectoderm cells with Cdx2 repressing
Oct4 expression.
Although the role of basic helix-loop-helix transcription factors in neurogenesis was first worked out in Drosophila as discussed above, it is clear
that related mechanisms also operate in vertebrates. For example, a basic

In a group of ectodermal cells, when one cell develops the gene expression

process of lateral inhibition results in the central cell differentiating into a
neuronal cell type (N), whereas the adjacent cells become epidermal cells (e).

helix-loop-helix protein known as neurogenin is involved in inducing the
formation of neuroblast precursor cells in vertebrates including mammals,
while another basic helix-loop-helix protein, NeuroD, is involved in subsequent neuronal differentiation. Similarly, a member of the Id protein family,
known as Id2, has an inhibitory role in preventing neuron-specific gene
expression in mammals and is degraded during neuronal differentiation.
This parallels the role of the inhibitory Emc protein in Drosophila, as well as
the role of the original Id protein in muscle differentiation (see Section 10.1).
Hence, neuronal differentiation in both Drosophila and mammals involves
basic helix-loop-helix transcription factors, paralleling the role of homeodomain-transcription factors in the early development of both flies and
mammals (see Chapter 9, Sections 9.2 and 9.3).
Thus, as in muscle cell-specific expression (see Section 10.1) activator
and repressor members of the helix-loop-helix family play a key role in regulating neuronal progenitor differentiation and neuron-specific gene expression in both mammals and Drosophila.

The ReST transcription factor represses the expression of
neuronal genes
In previous sections of this chapter, we have discussed how specific basic
helix-loop-helix proteins are expressed in neuronal or muscle precursor
cells and can then activate the expression of genes required in neurons or
muscle cells, respectively (Figure 10.31a). Clearly, cell type-specific gene
expression could also involve the release of transcriptional repression of
cell type-specific genes by a decrease in the abundance of a transcriptional
repressor protein during cellular differentiation (Figure 10.31b).
This has been observed in neuronal cell differentiation in the case of the
transcriptional repressor REST (Figure 10.31b). The REST protein is a zinc
finger transcription factor (see Chapter 5, Section 5.1, for discussion of this
family of transcription factors) in which the central DNA-binding domain is
flanked by N- and C-terminal transcription repression domains.
REST is expressed at high levels in pluripotent stem cells which can differentiate into a wide variety of cell types. This results in the expression of
neuronal genes in these cells being repressed (Figure 10.32). When these
stem cells differentiate to neuronal precursor cells, the transcription of the
REST gene continues and its mRNA level remains the same. However, the
REST protein is rapidly degraded resulting in lower levels of REST protein.
The lowered level of REST is still sufficient to repress at least some neuron-specific genes but leaves them poised for rapid activation. Subsequently,
when neuronal progenitors are induced to differentiate into neurons, the
gene encoding REST itself is transcriptionally repressed, allowing full activation of neuron-specific genes (Figure 10.32).
REST represses the expression of neuron-specific genes by binding to
specific DNA-binding sites via its central zinc finger domain. Each of the
two repressor domains can then recruit co-repressor complexes, which
induce a tightly packed chromatin structure preventing gene transcription
(Figure 10.33). The N-terminal inhibitory domain recruits the mSIN3
co-repressor complex which has histone deacetylase activity. Similarly,
the C-terminal repressor domain recruits the co-REST complex. This
co-REST complex contains a variety of different proteins that can induce a
tightly packed chromatin structure. These include the bromodomain protein BRG1 which is an ATP-dependent chromatin-remodeling enzyme, histone deacetylases and a histone demethylase (which produce histone

When pluripotent stem cells produce

reST levels (pale blue). Neuron-specific
genes (NSG) continue to be repressed but
are poised for activation. When neuronal
precursor cells subsequently differentiate
into mature neuronal cells, the gene
encoding reST is transcriptionally repressed,
thereby further reducing reST levels and
neuron-specific genes are activated.

modifications characteristic of inactive tightly packed chromatin), and the
MeCP2 protein (which binds specifically to methylated DNA) (Figure 10.33)
(see Chapters 2 and 3 for discussion of the effects of these factors on chromatin structure).
The REST factor can therefore recruit a number of factors which together
organize a tightly packed chromatin structure incompatible with gene
expression. These epigenetic effects allow neuron-specific genes to be
repressed in nonneuronal cells and to be poised for activation in neuronal
precursors.
As well as interacting with chromatin-modifying factors, REST also
interacts with the SCP2 (small C-terminal phosphatase 2) protein. This protein represses transcription by dephosphorylating the RNA polymerase II
C-terminal domain on serine 5. As described in Chapter 4 (Section 4.1),
such phosphorylation is essential for transcriptional initiation so SCP2 will
produce transcriptional repression.
In a novel regulatory mechanism, an miRNA (miR-26b) is transcribed
from an intron of the SCP2 gene and can bind to the SCP2 mRNA, inhibiting SCP2 gene expression. This miRNA is therefore unusual in that it is
transcribed from within its target gene. In nonneuronal cells, the initial
miR-26b transcript is not processed to its active form (see Chapter 1,
Section 1.5 for discussion of miRNA processing) so active SCP2 is
produced (Figure 10.34a). However, in neuronal cells, miR-26b is processed to its active form which inhibits SCP2 expression, so providing
another mechanism allowing REST to repress gene expression only in

and can associate with reST to inhibit target
gene expression (a). However, in neuronal

nonneuronal cells (Figure 10.34b). The decrease in REST synthesis due
to transcriptional and post-transcriptional regulation and the inhibition of
its co-factor SCP2 therefore results in the derepression of a number of
neuron-specific genes during neuronal differentiation.
When taken together with the studies on basic helix-loop-helix factors in
neuronal differentiation discussed above, these findings indicate that the
activation of neuron-specific gene expression as neuronal cells differentiate
involves both activation by positively acting transcription factors and the
release of repression by negatively acting transcription factors.

Neuronal cells express specific alternative splicing factors
The regulation of neuronal cell-specific gene expression at the level of chromatin structure and transcription discussed above is significantly supplemented by post-transcriptional regulation of gene expression. In particular,
a very large number of genes expressed in the nervous system are subject
to alternative splicing of the primary transcript (see Chapter 7, Section 7.1,
for a general discussion of alternative splicing and its regulation). Neuronally
expressed genes which are subject to alternative splicing include those
involved in axon pathfinding, the formation and function of synapses, and
cell adhesion.
Clearly, the nervous system is highly complex and alternative splicing
(as discussed in Chapter 7, Section 7.1) represents a convenient means of
generating multiple related forms of a protein with slightly different functions without requiring the existence of different genes. Furthermore, in terminally differentiated neuronal cells which do not divide, it is not possible
to utilize certain mechanisms for controlling chromatin structure and transcription which require cell division (see Chapter 3, Section 3.2). This results
in a greater need for post-transcriptional mechanisms such as alternative
splicing, to reprogramme gene expression in particular situations.
A key role in the regulation of alternative splicing in neuronal cells is
played by the nPTB splicing factor (also known as PTB2) whose downregulation in muscle cell differentiation was discussed in Section 10.1. Thus,
nPTB is expressed at high levels in neuronal cells but not in other cell types
whereas the related PTB protein (also known as PTB1) is expressed in other
cell types but is down-regulated in neuronal cells.
The balance between PTB and nPTB plays a key role in regulating specific splicing decisions (Figure 10.35). For example, in the presence of a

therefore included in the mrNA in a neuronspecific manner.

is not included in the mRNA because PTB represses inclusion of this exon.
In contrast, nPTB promotes the inclusion of this exon and the N1 exon is
therefore included in the Src mRNA in neuronal cells (Figure 10.35).
PTB and nPTB expression is controlled by a combination of different
mechanisms. The gene encoding PTB is expressed in nonneuronal cells but
not in differentiated neuronal cells, producing the appropriate pattern of
expression of PTB. In contrast, the gene encoding nPTB is expressed in both
neuronal and nonneuronal cells (Figure 10.36). However in nonneuronal
cells, PTB acts on the nPTB primary transcript to prevent exon 10 from being
included in the mRNA (Figure 10.36). This changes the translational reading
frame of the nPTB mRNA, introducing a premature translational stop codon.
This results in the nPTB mRNA being degraded by the nonsense-mediated
decay processes which target nonfunctional mRNAs (see Chapter 6, Section
6.7, for discussion of nonsense-mediated mRNA decay).
In neuronal cells where PTB is not expressed, exon 10 of the nPTB RNA
is included in the mRNA and a functional nPTB protein is therefore produced (Figure 10.36). These effects result in PTB being produced primarily in
nonneuronal cells whereas nPTB is primarily produced in neuronal cells.
This allows PTB and nPTB to differentially regulate specific splicing decisions in neuronal compared with nonneuronal cells.
The role of PTB/nPTB in neuronal cells has been explored by artificially
altering the expression of PTB or nPTB and then analyzing the effect. Most
importantly, it has been shown that inhibition of PTB expression in fibroblasts is sufficient to convert them into neuronal cells, indicating that the
PTB/nPTB system acts as a master regulator of neuronal differentiation paralleling the role of MyoD in muscle differentiation (see Section 10.1) but
acting at the post-transcriptional rather than the transcriptional level.
The effect of PTB/nPTB on alternative splicing decisions can be analyzed in detail by altering their expression and examining the effect on
the splicing of a wide variety of transcripts using microarray analysis
(see Figure 7.18). Interestingly, such studies have shown that this system
regulates up to 25% of all neuron-specific alternative splicing decisions,
indicating a very critical role for PTB/nPTB in this process. One of the genes
whose alternative splicing was identified by such screening procedures as
being regulated by PTB/nPTB was that encoding the MEF2 transcription
factor. Thus, in addition to the important role of MEF2 proteins in regulating
gene expression in muscle cells (see Section 10.1), these transcription factors are also expressed in other cell types. In particular, they play an important role in regulating gene expression in neuronal cells, in conjunction
with other transcription factors such as the basic helix-loop-helix proteins
and the REST protein discussed above.

The MEF2 genes contain a specific exon known as β, which encodes an
additional transcriptional activation domain. Inclusion of the β exon in the
mRNA therefore greatly enhances the ability of the resulting protein to activate transcription. It has been shown that PTB represses the inclusion of this
exon whereas nPTB allows its inclusion in the mRNA (Figure 10.37).
Hence, neuronal cells produce very active MEF2 proteins which can strongly
stimulate gene expression (Figure 10.37).
The nPTB protein therefore plays a critical role in neuron-specific alternative splicing events and is expressed widely in neurons throughout the
brain. Clearly, however, there will be situations where particular types of
neurons differ in their pattern of alternative splicing from that observed in
neurons in other regions of the brain. It is therefore of interest that other
alternative splicing factors such as Nova1 and Nova2 are expressed only in
certain regions of the brain. Nova1 for example, is expressed in neurons of
the hindbrain and spinal cord while Nova2 is expressed in neurons of the
cortex, hippocampus, and dorsal spinal cord. Again, these proteins regulate
numerous alternative splicing decisions in the neurons which express them
with, for example, approximately 7% of alternative splicing events in neuronal cells having been shown to be regulated by Nova2.
Interestingly, in an analysis of 40 proteins whose RNAs exhibited regulation of alternative splicing by Nova2, 35 had previously been shown to
exhibit a protein–protein interaction with at least one other protein. Importantly, in 26 (74%) of these cases the interactions involved one or more proteins whose RNA splicing was also regulated by Nova2 (Figure 10.38). This
suggests that Nova2 may regulate the alternative splicing of a network of
genes whose protein products interact together to regulate biological processes such as synaptic function in specific neuronal cells.

FIgURe 10.37
In nonneuronal cells, the pTB protein
promotes the exclusion of the β exon
from the rNA encoding MeF2, producing

more active form of the MeF2 transcription
factor (b).

Translational control plays a key role in synaptic plasticity

process, repeated activation of a specific synapse produces sustained potentiation of transmission across the synapse. This is of considerable importance since such mechanisms are likely to be involved in processes such as
learning and memory.
Potentiation of synaptic transmission involves an early phase that is
dependent upon the modification of preexisting proteins and a subsequent
later phase, known as long-term potentiation, which involves the synthesis of new proteins (Figure 10.39). This long-term potentiation phase is
regulated by translational control of protein synthesis involving the α form
of the translation initiation factor eIF2.
Phosphorylation of eIF2α by the GCN2 kinase occurs in neuronal cells
(Figure 10.40). As described in Chapters 7 (Section 7.6) and 8 (Section 8.6),
such phosphorylation inhibits its ability to stimulate translation of most
mRNAs. However, it enhances its ability to enhance the translation of the
mRNA encoding the transcription factor ATF4 (Figure 10.40). In turn, ATF
acts as a repressor of genes which are normally activated by the CREB transcription factor (see Chapter 8, Section 8.2).
Interestingly, activation of gene expression by CREB plays a critical role
in long-term potentiation of synaptic activity. Thus, the phosphorylation of
eIF2α by GCN2 will stimulate translation of ATF4 and thereby produce transcriptional inhibition of CREB target genes, leading to reduced long-term
potentiation (Figure 10.40). Hence, this system illustrates the co-operative
interaction of transcriptional and translational control processes, with
translational control regulating the synthesis of a transcription factor.
The regulation of ATF4 mRNA translation by eIF2α in mammalian cells
closely parallels the regulation of translation of the mRNA encoding the
yeast GCN4 transcription factor by eIF2α, which was discussed in Chapter
7 (Section 7.6). As in the case of GCN4, phosphorylation of eIF2α regulates
the balance between translation of small upstream open reading frames
in the ATF4 mRNA and the translation of the ATF4 coding sequence
(Figure 10.41). Thus, initially ribosomes translate a short three amino

ATF, so resulting in enhanced ATF4 production.

acid upstream open reading frame (UORF1) in the ATF4 mRNA. In the
presence of unphosphorylated eIF2α, when levels of eIF2-GTP are high
(see Chapter 7, Section 7.6) rapid translational reinitiation occurs at a second downstream open reading frame, known as UORF2. As this open
reading frame overlaps with the reading frame for the production of functional ATF4, its use suppresses ATF4 protein production (Figure 10.41). In
contrast, in the presence of phosphorylated eIF2α when levels of eIF2-GTP
are low, the ribosome fails to reinitiate translation at UORF2. This allows
translational reinitiation to occur at the start codon for ATF4, thereby
allowing functional ATF4 protein to be produced (Figure 10.41).
This system demonstrates the importance of translational control in a
major neuronal process, which is critical for the proper functioning of the
brain. Moreover, it indicates how transcriptional and translational control
can be combined to regulate the critical processes of long-term potentiation, leading to learning and memory formation.

miRNas play a key role in the regulation of neuronal gene
expression
As in muscle cells (Section 10.1), the expression of specific miRNAs in neuronal cells plays a key role in the regulation of gene expression and specific
examples of this have been discussed above. Interestingly, miR-124 is
expressed specifically in neuronal cells and represses the expression of a
number of genes whose protein products are required in nonneuronal cells
but not in neuronal cells. These include, for example, proteins involved in
cell proliferation. Introduction of miR-124 into nonneuronal cells results in
repression of these genes, whereas its inactivation in neuronal cells switches
on nonneuronal genes in the neuronal cells (Figure 10.42).
As well as regulating a number of different structural genes encoding
proteins not required in differentiated neurons, miR-124 also inhibits the
expression of regulatory genes encoding proteins involved in the control of
transcription and splicing. For example, miR-124 inhibits the expression of
the gene encoding the small C-terminal phosphatase protein (SCP1). Like
SCP2 (see above), SCP1 is recruited to gene regulatory regions by the binding of the REST transcriptional repressor and like SCP2 it inhibits transcription by dephosphorylating the C-terminal domain of RNA polymerase II.
Inhibiting SCP1 synthesis by miR-124 during neuronal cell differentiation
therefore limits the ability of REST to repress neuronal gene expression and
complements the down-regulation of REST itself which occurs during this
process (Figure 10.43).

The microrNA mir-124 regulates gene expression in neuronal cells at
multiple levels. By inhibiting SCp1 expression, it reduces reST activity,
allowing activation of neuronal genes (a). By inhibiting pTB, it enhances
npTB production resulting in neuron-specific alternative splicing (b). Finally,
it directly inhibits the expression of a number of nonneuronal genes in
neuronal cells (c).

Similarly, miR-124 also represses the expression of the gene encoding
the PTB alternative splicing factor. As discussed above, expression of PTB in
nonneuronal cells prevents the production of the related nPTB protein by
regulating the alternative splicing of its mRNA. Hence, down-regulation of
PTB by miR-124 during neuronal differentiation results in up-regulation of
nPTB, thereby promoting neuron-specific alternative splicing decisions
(Figure 10.44).
Clearly, miR-124 regulates neuronal gene expression at multiple levels.
As well as directly repressing the expression of structural genes encoding
proteins not required in neuronal cells, it also controls the expression of
regulatory proteins involved in transcription and alternative splicing. Such
regulatory proteins will in turn regulate their target genes either to allow
neuron-specific genes to be transcribed or to promote neuron-specific alternative splicing decisions (Figure 10.45).
Recently, PTB has been shown to have a further regulatory role in addition to regulating RNA splicing. It has been demonstrated that PTB can compete with miR-124 for binding to specific RNAs such as that encoding SCP1.
Such binding of PTB prevents miR-124 binding to the SCP1 RNA and inhibiting SCP1 gene expression. This therefore represents a feedback loop in
which miR-124 inhibits the expression of PTB while PTB inhibits the activity
of miR-124 (Figure 10.46).
Hence, in neuronal cells, as well as in muscle cells, miRNAs play a key
role in regulating gene expression. Moreover, they can act both by regulating the expression of specific genes whose protein products play
a direct role in neuronal cells and by regulating the expression of proteins which themselves have a regulatory role in the process of gene
expression.

 REGULATION OF YEAST MATING TYPE

377

RegULaTION OF YeaST MaTINg TYpe

Yeast cells can be a or α in mating type
In previous sections of this chapter we have discussed some of the regulatory mechanisms that control cell type-specific gene expression in the
vast array of differentiated cells found in multicellular organisms. Clearly,
expression of different genes within different cells of the same organism
does not occur in single-celled eukaryotes such as yeast, where the organism consists of only a single cell. Nonetheless, similar regulatory processes can operate in these organisms. Moreover, the relative simplicity of
these organisms greatly enhances our ability to analyze their control processes using both genetic and molecular biology techniques. Insights
obtained in this way may be relevant not only to the processes regulating
cell type-specific gene expression in multicellular organisms but also to
gene regulation during embryonic development, when each cell type must
be produced at an appropriate time and in an appropriate region of the
embryo relative to other differentiated cells (see Chapter 9 for discussion
of gene regulation in embryonic development).
In this section, we discuss the processes that regulate the production of
two distinct mating types in yeast, allowing the organism to have a form
of sexual reproduction. These haploid mating-type yeast cells, known as
a and α, can grow and divide or mate and fuse together to create a diploid
cell. The two mating types each express different genes encoding products
such as pheromones or pheromone receptors which are involved in mating to produce a diploid cell. Although the a and α mating types are distinct individual organisms of different phenotypes, they can be regarded
as analogous to the different types of differentiated cell in multicellular
eukaryotes.
In some yeast strains, known as heterothallic strains, the two mating
types are entirely separate as in multicellular organisms. However, we shall
discuss the situation in homothallic yeast strains where each cell can
switch its mating type from a to α or vice versa and behaves following
switching exactly as any other cell with its new mating type.
The process of switching is very precise. It occurs only in the G1 phase
of the cell cycle and only in a mother cell that has already produced a daughter by budding (Figure 10.47). The daughter cell itself does not switch
mating type until it has grown and become a mother cell which has itself
produced a daughter cell. This process is thought to be a consequence of
the need to produce diploid progeny rapidly. Switching from a to α or vice
versa allows this to occur among the progeny of a single cell without the
need for contact with another strain of different mating type.

Mating-type switching in yeast. Following
cell division, the larger mother cell, which

contrast, the daughter cell does not switch
until it has itself become a mother cell,
undergone cell division, and produced a

378

Chapter 10: Control of Cell Type-Specific Gene Expression

This process of mating-type switching in homothallic yeast is of interest in terms of gene control from two points of view. First, how does a cell
switch from a to α and vice versa? Second how is the expression of genes
expressed only in a or α cells regulated to produce the required pattern of
cell type-specific gene expression? These two questions will be considered
in turn.

Mating-type switching is controlled by regulating the
transcription of the HO gene
In homothallic yeast, whether a cell is a or α in mating type is controlled by
a single gene locus on chromosome 3 known as MAT (mating type). If this
transcriptionally active locus contains an a gene, the yeast cell is of a mating type whereas if it contains an α gene, the yeast cell is of α mating type.
In addition, the yeast cell also contains transcriptionally silent copies of both
the a and α genes elsewhere on chromosome 3 at the HML and HMR loci.
The change in mating type occurs via a cassette mechanism in which one
of the silent mating-type gene copies replaces the active gene at the MAT
locus so changing the mating type (Figure 10.48).
Hence, the switching of mating type is controlled by a DNA rearrangement event. In turn, this process is controlled by an endonuclease enzyme
which is the product of the HO (homothallism) gene and which makes a
double-stranded cut in the DNA at the MAT locus, initiating switching.
At first sight, a process involving DNA cutting by an endonuclease
appears to have little relevance to the study of gene control in higher organisms where, as discussed in Chapter 1 (Section 1.3), alterations in DNA such
as DNA rearrangements do not generally play a role in the regulation of
gene expression. In fact, however, expression of the HO endonuclease is
controlled at the transcriptional level by transcription factors which ensure
that the HO gene is transcribed only in the G1 phase of the cell cycle and
only in mother cells and not in daughter cells.

The SBF transcription factor activates hO transcription
only in the g1 phase of the cell cycle
Genetic analysis has defined a number of genes, known as SWI (switching)
genes whose protein products are necessary for HO gene expression. One
of these, Swi5, undergoes dephosphorylation which allows it to enter the
nucleus and bind to the HO gene promoter (Figure 10.49). In turn, this
allows the recruitment of the SWI/SNF complex which can open the chromatin (see Chapter 3, Section 3.5) and of the SAGA co-activator complex
which can acetylate histones (see Chapter 5, Section 5.2) (Figure 10.50).
These changes then allow the binding of the SBF protein complex composed of the Swi4 and Swi6 proteins to its DNA-binding site (Figure 10.50).
Binding of SBF to DNA is critical for transcriptional activation of the
HO gene, since it recruits basal transcription factors, such as TFIIB and the
RNA polymerase II itself (Figure 10.50). However, the ability of SBF to do
this is blocked by its association with the Whi5 inhibitory protein. In the G1
phase of the cell cycle, Whi5 is phosphorylated by cyclin-dependent protein
kinases that are only active at this phase of the cell cycle. This promotes
dissociation of Whi5 from SBF and the export of Whi5 from the nucleus,
allowing SBF to activate transcription (Figure 10.51).
Hence, HO gene transcription involves a cascade of steps which is initiated by the dephosphorylation of Swi5 and concludes with the phosphorylation of Whi5 allowing recruitment of the basal transcriptional complex and
consequent transcription. This transcription occurs only in the G1 phase of
the cell cycle when Whi5 is phosphorylated by cyclin-dependent kinases
that are active only in this phase of the cell cycle.

which then recruits the basal transcriptional complex (BTC)
including rNA polymerase II itself.

The ash-1 transcription factor represses hO transcription

Interestingly, as well as activating the gene encoding HO, Swi5 also activates the gene encoding the Ash-1 protein, although this occurs in a cell
cycle-independent manner. The Ash-1 gene is transcribed in both mother
and daughter cells throughout the cell cycle. However, its mRNA preferentially localizes to the daughter cell where it is translated to produce
Ash-1 protein. Ash-1 is a sequence-specific DNA-binding protein related
to the GATA-1 transcription factor that regulates erythroid (red blood cell)
development in mammals. Ash-1 binds to the HO promoter in daughter
cells and prevents its activation by Swi5 (Figure 10.52), thereby rendering HO gene transcription mother cell-specific.
In the mating-type system, transcription factors such as Swi5 and SBF
are activated post-translationally, representing examples of control of
transcription factor activity by phosphorylation and dephosphorylation
events, as discussed in Chapter 8 (Section 8.2). In contrast, synthesis of the
Ash-1 protein is regulated post-transcriptionally by controlling the localization of its mRNA, representing an example of gene control at the level of
mRNA localization, as discussed in Chapter 7 (Section 7.4). These two
mechanisms combine to regulate HO gene transcription, with regulation
of SBF activity resulting in the transcription of the HO gene only in the G1
phase of the cell cycle and regulation of Ash-1 synthesis ensuring that it
occurs only in mother and not in daughter cells. Therefore, even though
mating-type switching occurs via a DNA rearrangement, mediated by the
action of an endonuclease, the activity of the endonuclease and hence
switching itself are regulated at the level of gene transcription by several
co-operating control mechanisms.

The a and α gene products are homeodomain-containing

The transcriptional and post-transcriptional processes described above
therefore result in mating-type switching, with a particular yeast cell having

α gene product. The presence of the a or α gene product results in the yeast
cell being a or α in phenotype. Approximately 50 genes are transcribed at a
significantly higher level in a cells compared with α cells, while 32 genes are
transcribed at a significantly higher level in α cells compared with a cells.
This indicates that the a and α proteins are likely to act by regulating the
transcription of a number of different target genes.
Indeed, DNA sequence analysis of the a and α genes suggested that they
encode transcription factors. Thus, the a and α transcription factors have a
homeodomain DNA-binding region homologous to that found in a wide

The α1 and α2 proteins interact with the MCM1 transcription
factor to respectively activate α-specific genes and repress
a-specific genes
Hence, the a and α gene products act to produce the corresponding mating
type by regulating the expression of downstream target genes. Interestingly
however, this does not occur by a simple mechanism in which the a gene
product activates genes which are expressed at high levels in a mating-type
cells while the α gene product activates genes whose products are required
in α mating-type cells. Rather, the products of the a and α loci interact
together to regulate a- and α-specific genes (Figure 10.54).
In a mating-type cells, the a gene is transcribed resulting in the eventual
production of the a1 protein. However, the a1 protein does not directly activate a-specific genes. Rather these genes are activated by a constitutively
expressed protein, MCM1, which is a member of the MADS family of transcription factors that also includes the MEF2 transcription factors (see
Section 10.1) and the SRF transcription factor (see Chapter 8, Section 8.2).
In α mating-type cells which have an α gene in the MAT locus, this gene
is transcribed to produce two proteins, α1 and α2. The α1 protein specifically
interacts with MCM1 to activate expression of the α-specific genes whereas
the α2 protein interacts with MCM1 to repress expression of the a-specific
genes (Figure 10.54). This therefore results in activation of the a-specific
genes only in a mating-type cells while the α-specific genes are activated
only in α mating-type cells.
In turn, these differences in gene expression result from differences in the
binding of MCM1 to the promoters of a- and α-specific genes (Figure 10.55).
Thus, MCM1 binds as a dimer to a DNA sequence known as the P box in
a-specific genes and activates their expression. However when the α2 protein is present, it binds to DNA-binding sites flanking the P box and prevents
transcriptional activation by MCM1. Hence, the a-specific genes are transcribed only in a mating-type cells.
In contrast, MCM1 alone cannot activate expression of the α-specific
genes. This requires not only the binding of MCM1 to the P box in the regulatory region of these genes but also the binding of the α1 protein to the

In a mating-type cells, a dimer of the MCM1
transcription factor binds to the p box in
the a-specific genes and activates their
transcription (a). In α mating-type cells
activation of the a-specific genes by MCM1
is prevented by binding of the α2 protein
to its binding sites flanking the p box. In
contrast, the α-specific genes are activated
in α cells by the MCM1 dimers binding to
the p box and interacting with the α protein
bound to the adjacent Q box (b).

adjacent Q box. Thus, the interaction of the MADS family transcription factor MCM1 with the α1 and α2 homeodomain-containing transcription factors
results in the cell type-specific regulation of the a and α genes.
Hence, in this case, the ability of a constitutively expressed transcription
factor, MCM1, to activate gene expression is modulated by cell type-specific
transcription factors, with the α2 repressor preventing MCM1 from activating a-specific genes while the α1 activator protein co-operates with MCM1
to allow it to activate α-specific genes.

The a1 factor plays a key role in repressing haploid-specific
genes in diploid cells
Although the α1 and α2 proteins have a key role in regulating gene expression in α mating-type cells, this does not appear to be the case for a matingtype cells and the a1 protein even though the a1 protein is specifically
expressed in a and not in α mating-type cells (see Figure 10.54). Rather, the
a1 protein has a key role in regulating gene expression in diploid cells which
are produced by the fusion of a and α haploid cells.
Thus, the function of the mating-type system is to produce different
mating types, which under suitable conditions can fuse to form diploid
cells, providing yeast with the advantages of a sexual reproductive system
(Figure 10.56). This process involves the secretion of different pheromones by the a and α haploid cells (known, respectively, as a factor and α
factor), which bind to pheromone receptors on the a or α cell (Figure 10.56)
and induce fusion of the a and α haploid cells to form a diploid cell. Under
high nutrient conditions this diploid cell continues to grow and divide by
mitosis. However, under low nutrient conditions the diploid cell undergoes
a meiotic process to form haploid spores, which in turn can germinate to
produce a and α haploid cells. This allows the yeast to have a sexual reproductive cycle that generates genetic variation when the organisms are
exposed to poor conditions (Figure 10.56).
Evidently, the products of certain genes will be required in both a and α
haploid cells but not in diploid cells. These include, for example, the genes
encoding the a and α factor pheromones and their respective pheromone
receptors. Similarly, diploid cells have an a/α genotype and do not undergo

FIgURe 10.56
Cells of a mating type produce both an a-factor pheromone and an
α-factor pheromone receptor, while α mating-type cells produce an
α-factor pheromone and a receptor for the a-factor pheromone. Following
binding of the pheromone produced by one type of the cell to the receptor
on the other type of cell, the cells fuse to produce an a/α diploid. Under
high nutrient conditions, the diploid cell undergoes mitosis to produce
more a/α diploid cells. However, under poor nutrient conditions it
undergoes meiosis to produce a and α haploid spores, which can in turn
develop into a and α mating-type haploid cells, so promoting genetic
variation under poor conditions.

mating-type switching. Hence, they do not need to express the gene encoding the HO endonuclease.
These haploid-specific genes are repressed in diploids since only diploid
cells contain both the a1 protein and the α2 protein. The a1/α2 protein complex can bind to the promoters of the haploid-specific genes and repress
their expression (Figure 10.57). Interestingly, the a1/α2 protein complex
also prevents the expression of the α1 protein in diploid cells. Since α1 is
necessary for activation of the α-specific genes, they are not expressed in
diploid cells. Similarly, the a-specific genes will not be expressed in diploid
cells since they will be repressed by the α2 protein as described above.
Hence, diploid cells do not express either a- or α-specific genes nor do they
express haploid-specific genes such as that encoding HO itself and this
effect is dependent upon the presence of the a1/α2 protein complex which
is present only in diploid cells (Figure 10.57).
Hence, the HO gene is regulated by multiple mechanisms. The regulation of SBF activity results in it being expressed only in the G1 phase of the
cell cycle, the control of Ash-1 synthesis results in it being expressed only in
mother cells, and the presence of the a1/α2 complex in diploid cells results
in its repression in these cells (Figure 10.58).
In both haploid and diploid cells, the presence of the α2 protein at a promoter will result in its repression. When present alone, the α2 repressor
does not bind to DNA with high affinity. Rather, it is directed to distinct DNAbinding sites by interaction with either the MCM1 or a1 proteins. Interaction
with MCM1 occurs via an N-terminal region of α2. This results in dimerization of α2 which then binds to sites in the a-specific genes and represses
their expression (Figure 10.59). In contrast, the initial interaction of α2
with a1 results in a region at the C-terminal of α2 moving into an α-helical
configuration (Figure 10.60). In turn, this facilitates the formation of an
a1/α2 heterodimer which has a different binding specificity, leading to its
binding to specific sites in the haploid-specific genes (Figure 10.59).
The system for repression of haploid-specific genes described above
was originally defined in the Saccharomyces cerevisiae yeast species and
has been shown to operate in other yeasts such as Candida albicans.
However, in another yeast, Kluyveromyces lactis, an additional level of
complexity has been introduced. Thus, rather than repressing haploidspecific genes directly, in this species the a1/α2 heterodimer represses
the expression of the gene encoding the Rme1 protein. As Rme1 is
required for expression of the haploid-specific genes, this ensures that
these genes are indirectly repressed in the presence of the a1/α2 heterodimer (Figure 10.61).
However, it also allows the addition of an extraregulatory event. Thus,
in the K. lactis system expression of Rme1 requires the yeast to be starved as
well as the relief of repression by a1/α2. Hence these yeasts will only mate
when they are starved so that Rme1 expression is induced (Figure 10.61).
This example therefore illustrates how a simple regulatory mechanism
occurring in some yeasts can be modified in other yeast species to introduce
another layer of regulation.

In diploid cells the presence of both the a1
and α2 proteins leads to the formation of
an a1/a2 heterodimer, which binds to the
haploid-specific genes (HSG) and represses
their expression. This heterodimer also
blocks the expression of the α1 protein.
Since this protein is required for expression
of the α-specific genes (αSG), they are not
expressed in diploid cells. Similarly, the
a-specific genes (aSG) are not expressed in
diploid cells due to the presence of the α2
protein, which blocks the ability of MCM1 to
activate these genes in the same manner as
occurs in α haploid cells.

The α2 transcriptional repressor is guided to different genes by the MCM1 and a1 proteins. In the absence of the α2 protein in a haploid
cells, both the a-specific genes and the haploid-specific genes are transcribed (a). In α haploid cells, the α2 protein associates with MCM1
and represses the a-specific genes, whereas haploid-specific genes continue to be transcribed (b). In diploid cells association of MCM1 and
α2 represses the a-specific genes, as in α cells. In addition however, the haploid-specific genes are repressed by the a1/α2 heterodimer (c).

The yeast mating-type system offers insights of relevance to
multicellular organisms
As described in Chapter 1 (Section 1.3) changes in the DNA of cells, such
as DNA rearrangements (as well as DNA loss and DNA amplification) do
not appear to play a major role in the regulation of gene expression in
multicellular organisms. At first sight, a process such as the regulation of
yeast mating type which involves a DNA rearrangement event appears to
be of little relevance for the regulation of gene expression in multicellular
organisms.

Chapter 10: Control of Cell Type-Specific Gene Expression

However as discussed above, the detailed analysis of this process which
is possible in unicellular yeast has provided a number of insights that are
relevant to an understanding of gene regulation in multicellular organisms.
For example, all the regulatory proteins that are involved in this process
belong to families that include transcription factors that play a critical role
in multicellular organisms. The a and α gene products, for example, contain
a DNA-binding homeodomain which is also found in proteins that regulate
development in Drosophila and mammals (see Chapter 9, Sections 9.2 and
9.3), while the Ash-1 protein is related to the GATA-1 factor which regulates
gene expression in erythroid (red blood) cells. Similarly, the MCM1 protein
is a member of the MADS family of transcription factors which includes the
mammalian MEF2 transcription factors (see Section 10.1) and the serum
response factor (SRF, see Chapter 8, Section 8.2).
Moreover, the manner in which these factors interact with one another
indicates how the effects of one factor can be modified in the presence of
another factor. Thus, the ability of MCM1 to activate transcription is
blocked in the presence of the α2 transcription factor while α2 itself is
guided to different binding sites in the DNA depending on whether it
interacts with MCM1 or the a1 transcription factor. Interestingly, the
interaction between MCM1 and α2 is paralleled by the interaction between
the SRF factor and proteins of the homeodomain family in mammalian
and Drosophila cells, with homologous regions of MCM1 and SRF being
involved in each case.
Similarly as described in Chapter 11 (Section 11.3) cell cycle-specific
transcription is regulated in higher eukaryotes by cyclin-dependent kinases
which phosphorylate the Rb transcription factor, blocking its ability to
inhibit the activity of the E2F transcriptional activator. This evidently parallels the phosphorylation of the Whi5 protein by cyclin-dependent kinases,
which blocks its inhibitory interaction with SBF.
As well as such similar interactions between different transcription
factors, it is possible also to draw an analogy between the process of mating-type switching in single-celled yeast and the cell lineages that occur
in multicellular organisms. Thus, the switching system illustrated in
Figure 10.47 can be viewed as similar to a system in which a represents a
stem cell and α is a differentiated cell derived from it. If it is then assumed
that unlike the yeast situation switching from a to α is irreversible, the
model lineage illustrated in Figure 10.62 is obtained. In this model, the
stem cell is continually dividing to produce both a differentiated daughter
cell and another daughter cell which maintains the stem cell lineage. This
type of system is commonly found in higher organisms, being used in

CONCLUSIONS
the development of a number of different cell types and organisms
(see Chapter 3, Section 3.2 and Figure 3.15). Moreover, the specific partitioning of the Ash-1 mRNA to the daughter cell in the yeast mating-type
system (Figure 10.52) offers a simple model for how one regulatory process controlling the intracellular localization of an mRNA can result in
two cells produced by cell division developing completely different
phenotypes.

CONCLUSIONS
The three systems discussed in this chapter illustrate the critical role played
by transcription factors in regulating cell type-specific gene expression in
different cell types and organisms. This can involve the activation of target
genes by factors such as MyoD and the α1 yeast mating-type protein, or
their transcriptional repression by factors such as REST or the yeast α2
mating-type protein.
In all cases, the regulation of cellular phenotype will depend on the ability of an individual transcription factor to regulate the expression of many
target genes, so contributing to the specific phenotype of the particular type
of differentiated cell. Indeed, in some cases a single transcription factor can
actually produce the differentiated phenotype when it is expressed in an
undifferentiated cell. Thus, expression of the a or α gene controls whether
a yeast cell is a or α in phenotype. Similarly, MyoD or any of the three other
muscle regulatory genes can induce a differentiated muscle phenotype in
undifferentiated cells when each of them is overexpressed individually.
As described in this chapter, many transcription factors involved in the
regulation of cell type-specific gene expression are regulated at the level of
their synthesis, being produced only in the appropriate cell type during its
differentiation. For example, MyoD and the other muscle regulatory genes
are expressed only in skeletal muscle cells, the REST transcriptional repressor is expressed in nonneuronal cells but not in neuronal cells, and the a or
α mating-type genes are expressed only in the appropriate mating type. In a
number of these cases, the regulation of transcription factor synthesis
occurs at the level of transcription itself. Thus, the a or α genes are only
transcribed when they are present at the MAT locus and the presence of an
a or α gene at this locus determines the mating type of the cell. Similarly, the
REST gene is transcriptionally repressed when cells differentiate into neurons and the genes encoding muscle regulatory proteins such as MyoD are
transcribed only in skeletal muscle cells.
Nonetheless, post-transcriptional processes can also regulate the levels
of factors involved in the control of cell type-specific gene expression. For
example, before the transcriptional down-regulation of the REST gene, the
protein itself is destabilized resulting in its degradation in neuronal precursor cells. Similarly, the ATF4 transcriptional repressor is controlled at the
level of mRNA translation, while the activity of the MEF2 transcription factors can be controlled by the production of two different alternatively spliced
forms with different abilities to activate transcription.
It is important to note, however, that the regulation of transcription factors at the level of their activity rather than their synthesis also plays a role
in the regulation of cell type-specific gene expression. For example, the
MEF2 transcription factors are also regulated by post-translational modifications such as phosphorylation, acetylation, and sumoylation, which control
whether they function as transcriptional activators or transcriptional repressors. Similarly, the activity of the MyoD factor is regulated by its interaction
with the Id inhibitory protein. However, in general such regulation of transcription factor activity supplements the processes controlling transcription
factor synthesis in the regulation of cell type-specific gene expression,
rather than having a predominant role as occurs in the ability of transcription factors to regulate gene expression in response to cellular signaling
pathways (see Chapter 8).
As well as regulating transcription factor synthesis, post-transcriptional
processes also play a role in the overall regulation of cell type-specific gene

385

Chapter 10: Control of Cell Type-Specific Gene Expression

expression, complementing the regulation of transcription. For example,
the PTB and nPTB alternative splicing factors regulate the alternative splicing of a number of different RNAs resulting in a different pattern of exon
inclusion in neuronal cells where nPTB predominates, compared with other
cell types where PTB predominates.
Moreover as described in this chapter, for both skeletal muscle cells and
neuronal cells, miRNAs play an important role in regulating a number of
different target genes and as described in Chapter 7 (Section 7.7), such
regulation of gene expression by miRNAs occurs predominantly at the
post-transcriptional levels of RNA stability and mRNA translation.
Interestingly, the targets of miRNA-mediated regulation include not only
genes encoding cell type-specific structural proteins but also genes encoding regulatory proteins, such as transcription factors and alternative splicing
factors. In turn, altering the expression of these genes will affect the many
genes whose transcription or splicing are themselves regulated by these
regulatory factors. This provides the basis for regulatory networks in which
the regulation of a single miRNA can affect the expression of a large number of different genes either directly, or indirectly via genes encoding regulatory proteins.
These gene regulatory processes therefore allow a particular cell to
switch on a specific pattern of gene expression, as well as suppressing genes
characteristic of other cell types, and to do this in a stable manner. These
mechanisms provide a basis for understanding how individual differentiated cells can activate and repress the expression of a wide range of genes
in order to assume a particular differentiated phenotype.

KeY CONCepTS
•

The regulation of cell type-specific gene expression can involve
positively acting transcription factors (such as MyoD) which
activate genes expressed only in a particular cell type.

•

It can also involve negatively acting transcription factors (such
as REST) which repress genes expressed in other cell types.

•

In some cases, such as MyoD, the expression of a single
transcription factor is sufficient to induce the formation of a
particular type of differentiated cell.

•

Many transcription factors involved in the regulation of cell
type-specific gene expression are themselves regulated by
controlling their synthesis.

•

In addition, transcription factors involved in regulating cell
type-specific gene expression can be controlled by regulating
their activity, for example, by post-translational modifications
such as phosphorylation.

•

As well as transcriptional regulation by specific transcription
factors, cell type-specific gene regulation can also involve the
regulation of gene expression at post-transcriptional levels such
as alternative splicing or mRNA translation

•

miRNAs play a key role in such post-transcriptional regulation,
acting both on genes encoding structural proteins and on genes
encoding regulatory proteins such as transcription factors and
alternative splicing factors.

Gene Regulation and Cancer

INTRODUCTION
As we have discussed in preceding chapters, the regulation of gene expression in higher eukaryotes is a highly complex process. It is not surprising
therefore that this process can go wrong. Indeed, the identification of the
molecular basis of many human diseases has shown some to be due to
defects in gene regulation.
Although a wide variety of human diseases arise due to defects in gene
regulation, the human disease that exhibits the most extensive malregulation of gene expression is cancer. Not only does cancer often result from the
overexpression of certain cellular genes (known as proto-oncogenes) due to
errors in their regulation, but several of these genes themselves actually
encode transcription factors and cause the disease by affecting the expression of other genes. This chapter will therefore focus on the connection
between cancer and the malregulation of gene expression. It will illustrate
how our increasing knowledge of this connection has aided our understanding both of the disease and of the processes that regulate gene expression in normal and transformed cancer cells. Chapter 12 will focus on the
role of gene regulation in other human diseases as well as the potential
therapy of human diseases which may be possible by manipulating gene
regulatory processes.

11.1

GENE REGULATION AND CANCER

Oncogenes were originally identified in cancer-causing viruses
To provide a background to our discussion of cancer and gene regulation, it
is necessary to discuss briefly the nature of cancer-causing oncogenes and
the process that led to their discovery.
As long ago as 1911, Peyton Rous showed that a connective tissue cancer in the chicken was caused by an infectious agent. This agent was subsequently shown to be a virus and was named Rous sarcoma virus (RSV) after
its discoverer. This cancer-causing, tumorigenic virus is a member of a
class of viruses called retroviruses whose genome consists of RNA rather
than DNA as in most other organisms. The majority of viruses of this type do
not cause cancers or kill the infected cell.
The RSV genome contains an additional gene, known as the src gene,
which is absent in noncancer-causing retroviruses. This suggested that this
gene is responsible for the ability of the virus to cause cancer. This was
confirmed subsequently by showing that if the src gene alone was introduced into normal cells it was able to transform them to a cancerous phenotype. This gene was therefore called an oncogene (from the Greek onkas
for mass or tumor) or cancer-causing gene.

11

390

Chapter 11: Gene Regulation and Cancer

Following the identification of the src oncogene in RSV, a number of
other oncogenes were identified in other oncogenic retroviruses infecting
both chickens and mammals such as the mouse or rat (Table 11.1).

Cellular proto-oncogenes are present in the genome
of normal cells
The identification of individual genes that are able to cause cancer obviously opened up many avenues of investigation for the study of this disease.
From the point of view of gene regulation, however, the most exciting
aspect of oncogenes was provided by the discovery that these cancercausing genes are derived from genes present in normal cellular DNA. For
example, using Southern blotting techniques (Chapter 1, Methods Box 1.1),
a cellular equivalent of the viral src gene was detected in the DNA of both
normal and cancer cells. Moreover, it was shown that an mRNA capable of
encoding the Src protein was produced in normal cells.
Subsequent studies identified cellular equivalents of all the retroviral
oncogenes. When these cellular equivalents of the viral oncogenes were

cloned and characterized, they were shown to encode proteins identical or
closely related to those present in the retroviruses. To avoid confusion, the
viral oncogenes are given the prefix v, as in v-src, while their cellular equivalents are designated proto-oncogenes and given the prefix c, as in c-src.
Over 20 cellular proto-oncogenes which were originally identified in this
way are now known (Table 11.1).
The presence of cellular equivalents of the retroviral oncogenes suggests that the viral genes have been picked up from normal cellular
DNA following integration of a non-tumorigenic virus next to the protooncogene. The subsequent incorrect excision of the viral genome resulted
in its picking up the gene and converted it into a tumorigenic virus
(Figure 11.1). Hence the oncogene in the virus is derived from a cellular
gene which is present in the DNA of normal cells.

Cellular proto-oncogenes can cause cancer when they are
overexpressed or mutated
Paradoxically the same gene can be present in normal cells without any
apparent adverse effect and yet can cause cancer when incorporated into
a virus. It is now clear that this conversion of the proto-oncogene into a
cancer-causing oncogene is caused by one of two processes. Either the
gene is mutated in some way within the virus so that an abnormal product
is formed, or alternatively the gene is expressed within the virus at much
higher levels than are achieved in normal cells and this high level of the
normal product results in transformation (Figure 11.2).
Such conversion of a proto-oncogene into a cancer-causing oncogene is
not confined to viruses, however. Cases of cancer which have no viral
involvement in humans have now been shown to be due either to the overexpression of individual cellular proto-oncogenes or to their alteration by
mutation within the cellular genome. Hence, these genes play an important
role in the generation of human cancer.
The potential risk of such proto-oncogenes causing cancer raises the
question of why these genes have not been deleted during evolution. In
fact, proto-oncogenes have been highly conserved in evolution, equivalents to mammalian and chicken oncogenes having been found not only in
other vertebrates but also in invertebrates such as Drosophila and even in
single-celled organisms such as yeast.
The extraordinary evolutionary conservation of many of these genes,
despite their potential danger, led to the suggestion that their products
were essential for the processes regulating the growth of normal cells and
that their malregulation or mutation therefore results in abnormal growth
and cancer. This idea has been confirmed abundantly as more and more
proto-oncogenes have been characterized and shown to encode growth
factors that stimulate the growth of normal cells, cellular receptors for
growth factors, and other cellular proteins involved in transmitting the
growth signal within the cell, either by acting as a protein kinase enzyme
or by binding GTP (Table 11.1).
Ultimately the growth regulatory pathways controlled by oncogene
products end in the nucleus with the activation of genes whose corresponding proteins are required by the growing cell. It is not surprising therefore
that several proto-oncogenes have been shown to encode transcription
factors that regulate the expression of genes activated in growing cells
(Table 11.2).
Hence, oncogenes present two aspects of importance from the point of
view of the regulation of gene expression. First, since cancer is often caused
by elevated expression of cellular oncogenes, the processes whereby this
occurs are of interest both from the point of view of the etiology of cancer
and for the light they throw on the mechanisms that control gene expression. This topic is discussed below. Second, the study of the transcription
factors encoded by several proto-oncogenes has led to a better understanding of the processes regulating gene expression in cells growing normally
and in cancer cells. This is discussed in Section 11.2.

Elevated expression of oncogenes can be produced by viruses
or by cellular mechanisms
The products of cellular proto-oncogenes play a critical role in cellular
growth control and in many cases are synthesized only at specific times and
in small amounts. It is not surprising therefore, that transformation into a
cancer cell can result when these genes are expressed at high levels in particular situations.
The simplest example of such overexpression occurs in the case of retroviruses where the oncogene comes under the influence of the strong retroviral promoter and is hence expressed at a high level (Figure 11.2).
Of much greater interest however, are cases where up-regulation of a
cellular oncogene occurs through the alteration of internal cellular regulatory processes rather than within a retrovirus. The best-studied example of
this type concerns the increased expression of the c-myc oncogene which
occurs in the transformation of B cells in cases of Burkitt’s lymphoma in
humans or in the similar plasmacytomas that occur in mice.
When these tumors were studied, it was noted that they commonly contained very specific chromosomal translocations which involved the
exchange of genetic material between chromosome 8 and chromosome 14
(Figure 11.3). Most interestingly, the region of chromosome 8 involved
includes the c-myc gene and the translocation results in the myc gene being
moved to chromosome 14 where it becomes located adjacent to the gene
encoding the immunoglobulin heavy chain. This translocation results in the
increased expression of the myc gene which is observed in the tumor cells.
Such translocation of specific oncogenes to the immunoglobulin locus
resulting in increased expression is not unique to the myc gene but has been
observed for a variety of other oncogenes in different B-cell leukemias.
Moreover, similar translocations involving oncogene translocation to the
T-cell receptor gene locus (which is highly expressed in T lymphocytes)
have been observed in T-cell leukemias (see also Section 11.2). The mechanisms responsible for the observed up-regulation of oncogene expression
have been best described, however, in the case of the myc oncogene and
these will now be discussed.

A variety of cellular mechanisms mediate enhanced expression
of proto-oncogenes in different cancers
Detailed study of the processes mediating increased myc gene expression
has indicated that it is produced by different mechanisms in different

Hence, in this case the c-myc gene is up-regulated by the action of the
B-cell-specific regulatory mechanisms of the immunoglobulin gene, the
immunoglobulin enhancer activating the c-myc promoter rather than its
own promoter which has been removed by the translocation. In other cases
however, this does not appear to be the case, the breakpoint of the translocation having removed both the immunoglobulin promoter and enhancer.
This leaves the c-myc gene adjacent to the constant region of the immunoglobulin gene without any obvious B-cell-specific regulatory elements. In
these cases it is likely that the up-regulation of the c-myc gene arises from
its own truncation in the translocation. This results in the removal of negative regulatory elements that normally repress its expression, such as the
upstream silencer element which normally represses the c-myc promoter
(see Chapter 4, Section 4.4 and Figure 11.6).
More extensive truncation of the c-myc gene involving the removal of
transcribed sequences rather than upstream elements has also been observed
in some tumors. Frequently, this involves the removal of the first exon of the
c-myc gene which does not contain any protein-coding information. This
exon may thus fulfill a regulatory role by modulating the stability of the
c-myc RNA or by affecting its translatability. Hence, its removal could
enhance the level of c-myc protein by increasing the stability or the efficiency
of translation of the c-myc RNA produced at a constant level of transcription.
A similar increase in gene expression could be achieved by the removal of
sequences within the first intervening sequence which inhibit the transcriptional elongation of the nascent c-myc transcript (see Chapter 5, Section 5.4).
The increased expression of an oncogene produced by the removal of
sequences that negatively regulate it is also seen in the case of the lck
proto-oncogene which encodes a tyrosine kinase related to the c-src gene
product. In this case, activation of the oncogene in tumors is accompanied
by the removal of sequences within its 5′ untranslated region, upstream of
the start site of translation. The removal of these sequences results in a
50-fold increase in the initiation of translation of the lck mRNA into protein.
Most interestingly, the region removed contains three AUG translation
initiation codons which are located upstream of the correct initiation codon
for production of the Lck protein (Figure 11.7). The elimination of these

codons results in increased translation initiation from the correct AUG, suggesting that initiation at the upstream codons inhibits correct initiation. This
is exactly analogous to the regulation of translation of the GCN4 and ATF4
transcription factors, which was discussed, respectively, in Chapter 7
(Section 7.6) and Chapter 10 (Section 10.2).
It is likely that the processes regulating the expression of oncogenes
such as c-myc and lck, which are revealed by studying their overexpression
in tumors, also play a role in their normal pattern of regulation during cellular growth. Hence, their further study will throw light not only on the
mechanisms of tumorigenesis but also on the processes regulating gene
expression in normal cells.
Other examples of up-regulation of oncogene expression in tumorigenesis may occur, however, by mechanisms that are unique to the transformed
cell. For example, as discussed in Chapter 1 (Section 1.3), DNA amplification
is relatively rare in normal cells. In tumors, however, it is observed frequently for specific oncogenes and results in the presence of regions of
amplified DNA which are visible in the microscope as homogeneously
staining regions or as double minute chromosomes. Such amplification
is especially common in human lung tumors and brain tumors and frequently involves the c-myc-related genes, N-myc and L-myc. The expression
of these genes in the tumor is increased dramatically due to the presence of
up to 1000 copies of the gene in the tumor cell.
A variety of mechanisms involving both the subversion of normal control processes or abnormal events occurring in the tumor cell therefore
result in the observed overexpression of oncogenes in tumor cells. In turn,
such overexpression is critical for tumor formation. For example, if the high
levels of c-myc in a mouse model of liver cancer are reduced, the tumor
cells lose their cancerous phenotype and differentiate into hepatocytes. If
overexpression of c-myc is then restored, the cells return to a cancerous
phenotype. When taken together with the production of abnormal oncogene products due to mutations, it is likely that the overexpression of specific oncogenes is involved in a wide variety of human cancers.

11.2 ONCOGENIC TRANSCRIpTION FACTORS
As described in Section 11.1, the isolation of the cellular genes encoding
particular oncogene products led to the realization that they were involved
in many of the processes regulating cellular growth. Ultimately the onset
and continuation of cellular growth is likely to involve the activation of cellular genes that are not expressed in quiescent cells. It is not surprising
therefore that several proto-oncogenes have been shown to encode transcription factors which regulate the transcription of genes activated in
growing cells (Table 11.2). Several of these cases will be discussed.

The Fos and Jun oncogene proteins are cellular transcription
factors which can cause cancer when overexpressed
The chicken retrovirus avian sarcoma virus AS17 contains an oncogene,
v-jun, whose equivalent cellular proto-oncogene encodes a nuclearly
located DNA-binding protein. Sequence analysis of this protein revealed
that it showed significant homology to the DNA-binding domain of the
yeast transcription factor GCN4, suggesting that it might bind to similar
DNA sequences (Figure 11.8). Interestingly, GCN4 itself had been shown

previously to bind to similar sequences to those bound by the AP1 (activator protein 1) factor which had been detected in mammalian cell extracts by
its DNA-binding activity (Figure 11.9).
This relationship of Jun and AP1 to the sequence and binding activity,
respectively, of GCN4 led to the suggestion that Jun might be related to AP1.
This was confirmed by the findings that antibody to Jun reacted with purified
AP1 preparations and that Jun expressed in bacteria was capable of binding
to AP1-binding sites in DNA. Moreover, Jun was capable of stimulating transcription from promoters containing AP1-binding sites but not from those
that lacked these sites. Hence, the jun oncogene encodes a sequence-specific
DNA-binding protein capable of stimulating transcription of genes containing its binding site, which is identical to the AP1-binding site.
Although Jun undoubtedly binds to AP1-binding sites, preparations of
AP1 purified on the basis of this ability contain several other proteins in
addition to c-Jun. Several of these are encoded by genes related to jun but
another is the product of a different proto-oncogene namely c-fos. Although
Fos is present in AP1 preparations, it does not bind to DNA when present
alone but requires the product of the c-jun gene for DNA binding. Hence, in
addition to its ability to bind to AP1 sites alone, Jun can also form a complex
with Fos that binds to this site. As discussed in Chapter 5 (Section 5.1), this
association takes place through the leucine zipper domains of the two proteins. This results in a Fos/Jun heterodimer which binds to the AP1-binding
site with much greater affinity than the Jun homodimer.
Both Fos and Jun, which were identified originally through their association with oncogenic retroviruses, are thus also cellular transcription factors. Such a finding raises the question of the normal role of these factors
and how they can cause cancer. In this regard it is of obvious interest that
the AP1-binding site is involved in mediating the induction of genes that
contain it in response to treatment with phorbol esters, which are also
capable of promoting cancer. Not only do many phorbol ester-inducible
genes contain AP1-binding sites (see Table 4.3), but in addition, transfer of
AP1-binding sites to a normally non-inducible gene renders that gene
inducible by phorbol esters. Increased levels of Jun and Fos are also
observed in cells after treatment with phorbol esters. Hence, these substances act by increasing the levels of Fos and Jun, which in turn cause
increased transcription of other genes containing AP1-binding sites that
mediate induction by the Fos–Jun complex.
In the case of the ccl2 gene, binding of Jun to multiple APl sites has been
shown to produce a cascade of changes which result in activation of the
gene. These include phosphorylation of histone H3 on serine 10 and histone
acetylation, both of which are associated with an open chromatin structure
(see Chapter 2, Section 2.3 and Chapter 3, Section 3.3), as well as recruitment of the NFκB transcription factor and recruitment of RNA polymerase II
itself (Figure 11.10).
Most interestingly, increased levels of Jun and Fos are produced by treatment with serum or growth factors which stimulates the growth of quiescent
cells. Hence, the transduction of the signal to grow which begins with the
growth factors and their cellular receptors and continues with intracytoplasmic signal transducers such as protein kinases and GTP-binding proteins,
ends in the nucleus with the increased level of the transcription factors Jun
and Fos (Figure 11.11). These proteins will then activate the genes whose
products are necessary for the process of growth itself.

Clearly, it is relatively easy to fit the oncogenic properties of Jun and Fos
into this framework. Thus, if these proteins are normally produced in
response to growth-inducing signals and activate growth, their continual
abnormal synthesis will result in a cell which will be stimulated to grow
continually and will not respond to growth-regulating signals. Such continuous uncontrolled growth is characteristic of the cancer cell.
In agreement with this idea, mutations in the leucine zipper region of
Fos, which abolish its ability to dimerize with Jun and induce genes containing AP1 sites, also abolish its ability to transform cells to a cancerous phenotype. Hence, the ability of Fos to cause cancer is directly linked to its
ability to act as a transcription factor for genes containing the appropriate
binding site.
Interestingly, as well as being regulated at the level of synthesis, Jun
can also be regulated at the level of its activity (see Chapter 8, Section 8.1
for discussion of the regulation of transcription factors at the level of synthesis or activity). Thus, phosphorylation of the Jun protein on serines 63
and 73 near the N-terminus of the protein greatly enhances its ability
to activate transcription. This is dependent at least in part on the ability
of dephosphorylated but not phosphorylated Jun to interact with the

The v-erbA oncogene protein is a mutant form of the cellular
thyroid hormone receptor
Unlike most other retroviruses, avian erythroblastosis virus (AEV) carries
two cellular oncogenes, v-erbA and v-erbB. When c-erbA, the cellular
equivalent of v-erbA, was cloned it was shown to encode the cellular receptor that mediates the response to thyroid hormone.
As discussed in Chapter 5 (Sections 5.1 and 5.3), this receptor is a member of the nuclear receptor family, which following binding of a particular
hormone, induce the transcription of genes containing a binding site for the
hormone–receptor complex. The cellular ErbA protein contains a region
that can bind thyroid hormone. Following such binding, the hormone–
receptor complex induces transcription of thyroid hormone-responsive
genes, such as those encoding growth hormone or the heavy chain of the
myosin molecule (Figure 11.13).
The finding that the cellular homolog of the v-erbA oncogene is a
hormone-responsive transcription factor provides a further connection
between oncogenes and cellular transcription factors. It raises the question, however, of the manner in which the transfer of the thyroid hormone
receptor to a virus can result in transformation. To answer this question it
is necessary to compare the protein encoded by the virus with its cellular
counterpart. As shown in Figure 11.14, the cellular ErbA protein has the
typical structure of a member of the nuclear receptor family (see also
Figure 5.22), containing both DNA-binding and hormone-binding regions.
The viral ErbA protein is generally similar except that it is fused to a portion
of the retroviral gag protein at its N-terminus. It also contains a number of
mutations in both the DNA-binding and hormone-binding regions, as well
as a small deletion in the hormone-binding domain.
Of these changes, it is the alterations in the hormone-binding domain
that have the most significant effects on the function of the protein and are
thought to be critical for transformation. These changes abolish the ability of
the protein to bind thyroid hormone and activate transcription. However, the

protein retains the inhibitory domain which allows the ErbA protein to
repress gene transcription in the absence of thyroid hormone (see Chapter 5,
Section 5.3). The viral protein is therefore functionally analogous to the
alternatively spliced form of the c-erbA gene product discussed in Chapter 5
(Section 5.3), which lacks the hormone-binding domain and dominantly
represses the ability of the hormone-binding receptor form to activate thyroid hormone-responsive genes.
The idea that the nonhormone-binding viral ErbA protein might also
be able to do this has been confirmed by studying the effect of this oncogene on thyroid hormone-responsive genes. As expected, the v-erbA gene
product was able to abolish the responsiveness of such genes to thyroid
hormone by binding to the thyroid hormone response elements in their
promoters and preventing activation by the cellular ErbA protein–thyroid
hormone complex (Figure 11.15).
Interestingly, however, this repression by v-erbA does not simply involve
the passive blockage of binding by c-erbA following thyroid hormone treatment. Thus, mutations in the inhibitory domain described in Chapter 5
(Section 5.3) can abolish the oncogenic activity of v-erbA. These mutations
do not affect the ability of v-erbA to bind to DNA but prevent it from recruiting the inhibitory co-repressor which is essential for its ability to actively
repress transcription. Hence the ability to actively repress transcription is
essential for transformation by v-erbA (Figure 11.16).
The explanation of how such gene repression by viral ErbA can result in
transformation is provided by the observation that the introduction of the
viral gene into cells can repress transcription of the avian erythrocyte anion
transporter gene. This gene is one of those that is switched on when chicken
erythroblasts differentiate into erythrocytes. It has been known for some
time that the viral ErbA protein can block this process and it is now clear
that this is achieved by blocking the induction of the genes needed for this
to occur. In turn, such blockage of differentiation allows the cells to continue to proliferate. When this is combined with the introduction of the
v-erbB gene, which encodes a truncated form of the epidermal growth factor receptor and renders cell growth independent of external growth factors,
transformation results (Figure 11.17).
Transformation caused by v-erbA thus represents an example of the
activation of an oncogene by mutation, resulting in this case in its losing the
ability to activate transcription but retaining its ability to act as a dominant
repressor of transcription. As discussed in Chapter 5 (Section 5.3), however,
one alternatively spliced transcript of the c-erbA gene is also able to do this
and like the v-erbA gene product, cannot bind thyroid hormone. Hence, this
repression of transcription by a nonhormone-binding form of the receptor
is likely to be of importance in normal cells also.
Interestingly, other members of the nuclear receptor family to which the
thyroid hormone receptor belongs (see Chapter 4, Section 4.3 and Chapter
5, Section 5.1 for discussion of this transcription factor family), also play a

role in specific cancers. Thus, for example, many breast cancers are dependent on estrogen-mediated activation of the estrogen receptor for their
growth and a similar relationship involving androgen-mediated activation
of the androgen receptor exists in prostate cancer. The FoxA1 protein which
acts as a pioneer transcription factor opening up the chromatin so these
receptors can bind (see Chapter 3, Section 3.5) exhibits altered expression
in both breast and prostate cancers and may therefore play a key role in the
development of these cancers.

Other transcription factor-related oncogenes are overexpressed
due to chromosomal translocations
Although the fos-jun and erbA cases represent well-characterized examples
of the connection between oncogenes and transcription factors, several
other cellular oncogenes also encode transcription factors (see Table 11.2).
One of these, the Myc protein, has been studied intensively in view of
its overexpression in many human tumors due to its involvement in
tumor-specific chromosomal translocations (see Section 11.1). The Myc
protein clearly encodes a transcription factor which contains the leucine
zipper motif characteristic of many transcription factors including Fos and
Jun, as well as a helix-loop-helix motif (see Chapter 5, Section 5.1).
Moreover, mutations in the leucine zipper region of the protein abolish its
oncogenic ability to transform normal cells, suggesting that the ability to
act as a transcription factor is essential for Myc-induced transformation.
Despite all this evidence, for many years the actual role of Myc in transcriptional control remained unclear. This was because it was not possible
to demonstrate the binding of Myc to a specific DNA sequence in the manner that had been shown to occur for Jun and ErbA. This problem was
resolved, however, by the finding that Myc has to heterodimerize with a
second factor known as Max, in order to bind to specific DNA sequences in
its target genes and activate transcription (Figure 11.18a). Myc therefore
resembles Fos in requiring another factor for sequence-specific binding.
This finding indicates once again the importance of heterodimerization in
regulating the activity of transcription factors and also illustrates how the
function of a particular factor can remain obscure simply because its partner has not yet been isolated.
As well as regulating transcriptional initiation, it has been shown that
Myc can also stimulate transcriptional elongation by interacting with the
pTEF-b kinase (Figure 11.18b). As discussed in Chapter 4 (Section 4.2) this
kinase plays a key role in transcriptional elongation by phosphorylating
serine 2 in the C-terminal domain of the RPB1 subunit of RNA polymerase
II, thereby releasing paused polymerase and allowing transcriptional elongation to occur. Interestingly, the transcription of the c-myc gene itself has
been shown to be regulated at the level of transcriptional elongation by a
process involving pTEF-b (see Chapter 5, Section 5.4). Hence, pTEF-b both
regulates c-myc gene expression and interacts with the Myc protein to regulate other genes.
As well as regulating transcription, at both initiation and elongation Myc
can also regulate the translation of mRNAs. This is achieved by Myc binding
to the TFIIH component of the basal transcriptional complex (see Chapter 4,
Section 4.1). In turn, TFIIH interacts with the cap guanine methyltransferase
enzyme and stimulates its activity. The cap guanine methyltransferase is
responsible for methylating the cap at the 5′ end of the mRNA on the 7 position of the guanine base, so converting the 5′-Gppp cap to a 5′-me7Gppp
cap (see Chapter 6, Section 6.1). This methylated cap strongly promotes
translation of the mRNA compared with the unmethylated cap. The stimulation of cap methylation by Myc therefore results in Myc stimulating mRNA
translation (Figure 11.18c).
As described in Section 11.1 the myc gene was initially identified by studies on RNA tumor viruses and subsequently shown to be overexpressed in
many human cancers due to chromosomal translocations. In addition,

however, a number of oncogenes encoding transcription factors have been
identified specifically on the basis of their involvement in the chromosomal
translocations which occur in human leukemias, as well as in some solid
tumors. As well as involving previously characterized oncogenes such as
the myc gene, these translocations can involve genes not previously shown
to produce cancer when overexpressed. For example, a member of the
homeodomain family of transcription factors (see Chapter 5, Section 5.1
and Chapter 9, Section 9.3), has been shown to be involved in cases of acute
childhood leukemia where its expression is activated by translocation to the
T-cell receptor gene locus.

Chromosomal translocations can also produce novel oncogenic
fusion proteins involving transcription factors
As well as resulting in increased expression of a proto-oncogene by translocation to a highly active immunoglobulin or T-cell receptor gene locus
(Figure 11.19a), chromosomal translocations can also cause leukemias or
solid tumors by producing fusion genes between two genes which were
previously located on separate chromosomes (Figure 11.19b). The corresponding fusion proteins presumably produce cancer because the fusion
protein has cancer-causing properties distinct from those of either intact
protein alone. Thus, the fusion protein which is present in 15% of human
acute myeloid leukemias involves the AML and ETO transcription factors.
This AML–ETO fusion protein is able to bind to basic helix-loop-helix factors
(see Chapter 5, Section 5.1) and prevent them binding the CBP co-activator,
thereby acting as a transcriptional repressor.
Such chromosomal translocation can also involve factors regulating
transcriptional elongation rather than transcriptional initiation. For example, the ELL gene, which is involved in chromosomal translocations leading
to fusion protein products in acute myeloid leukemia, is a transcription
elongation factor and is a component of the super elongation complex
(SEC) discussed in Chapter 5 (Section 5.4).
As in the case of translocations causing overexpression, such translocations can involve genes encoding transcription factors previously identified
within RNA tumor viruses or those which have not previously been shown
to have an oncogenic effect. For example, the c-ets-1 proto-oncogene (see
Chapter 5, Section 5.1) was originally identified in a chicken retrovirus (see
Table 11.1). Subsequently it was shown that the c-ets-1 gene becomes

fused to the platelet-derived growth factor receptor gene in chronic myelomonocytic leukemia. In contrast, in acute promyelocytic leukemia (PML)
the translocation involves the fusion of two transcription factor genes not
characterized in oncogenic retroviruses, namely the retinoic acid receptor
α gene (a member of the nuclear receptor family discussed in Chapter 5,
Section 5.1) and the PML transcription factor, a zinc finger transcription
factor which was originally characterized on the basis of its involvement in
this disease.
As in the case of the AML–ETO fusion protein, the RAR–PML fusion protein acts as a transcriptional repressor even though the retinoic acid receptor alone can act as an activator. This inhibitory activity of RAR-PML
involves its ability to recruit histone deacetylases and produce an inactive
chromatin structure. Indeed, the AML–ETO fusion protein can also bind
histone deacetylases (in addition to its effect on CBP binding by basic helixloop-helix factors). This suggests that enhanced deacetylation induced by
oncogenic fusion proteins may play a critical role in human leukemia
(Figure 11.20) and may be a target for therapy (see Chapter 12, Section 12.5).
The role in cancer of changes in histone modifications, such as acetylation
is discussed further in Section 11.4.
As well as producing a novel fusion protein, a chromosomal translocation can also produce large amounts of a fusion protein which is present in small amounts in normal cells. This is observed in a chromosomal
translocation that occurs in human endometrial tumors. This translocation produces a fusion protein derived from the JJAZ1 member of the
polycomb protein family and another protein encoded by the JAZF1 gene.
This fusion protein can enhance the growth of cells and protect them
from stimuli that would otherwise induce cell death, explaining why it is
oncogenic.
Most interestingly, however, this fusion protein is also made at low levels
in normal endometrial cells by a different process. Thus, in normal cells, the
fusion protein is encoded by a novel mRNA produced by trans-splicing of
exons from the JAZF1 and JJAZ1 RNA transcripts. In this case therefore, cancer would be produced by a DNA translocation leading to overexpression of
a fusion protein which is made at low levels by a trans-splicing process in
normal cells (Figure 11.21). Another example of a polycomb protein which
is involved in cancer is discussed in Section 11.4. (See Chapter 3, Section 3.3
and Chapter 5, Section 5.1) for general discussion of the role of polycomb
proteins in gene expression.)

11.3 TUMOR SUppRESSOR TRANSCRIpTION
FACTORS
Tumor suppressor genes encode proteins which restrain
cellular growth
Following the discovery of cellular oncogenes it was rapidly shown that
they encoded proteins which promoted cellular growth so that their activation by overexpression or by mutation resulted in abnormal growth leading
to cancer. Subsequently however, it became clear that cancer could also
result from the deletion or mutational inactivation of another group of
genes. This indicated that these genes encoded products which normally
restrained cellular growth so that their inactivation would result in abnormal, unregulated growth. These genes were therefore named tumor suppressor genes or anti-oncogenes.
Clearly the inhibitory role of tumor suppressor genes indicates that
cancers will involve the deletion of these genes or the occurrence of mutations within them which inactivate their protein product, rather than their
overexpression or mutational activation as occurs for the oncogenes
(Figure 11.22). A number of genes of this type have been defined on the
basis of their mutation or deletion in specific tumor types (Table 11.3).
Most interestingly, three of the best-defined tumor suppressor genes all
encode transcription factors. Two of these, p53 and the Wilms’ tumor gene
product, appear to act by binding to target sites in the DNA of specific
genes and regulating their expression while the third, the retinoblastoma
gene product (Rb-1), acts predominantly via protein–protein interactions
with other regulatory transcription factors. The p53 and Rb-1 proteins will
therefore be discussed as examples of these two types.

Normal gene

The p53 protein is a DNA-binding transcription factor
The p53 protein was originally identified as a 53 kDa protein which bound to
the large T oncogene protein of the small DNA virus SV40. Subsequent
studies have shown that the gene encoding this protein is mutated in a very
wide variety of human tumors, especially carcinomas. In normal cells, p53
is induced in response to DNA damage and its activation results in growth
arrest and/or cell death. Most interestingly, inactivation of the p53 gene in
mice does not prevent the normal development of the animal. Rather it
results in an abnormally high rate of tumor formation which results in the
early death of the animal. This has led to the idea that the p53 gene product
normally acts to prevent cells with damaged DNA from proliferating by
inducing their growth arrest or death. In the absence of p53 such cells proliferate and form tumors which occur at high frequency when p53 is inactivated by mutation.
The detailed characterization of the p53 gene product has shown that it
is a transcription factor capable of binding to a specific DNA sequence and

activating the expression of specific genes. The mutations which occur in
human tumors result in a loss of the ability to bind to this specific DNA
sequence, indicating that the ability of p53 to do this is crucial for its ability
to control cellular growth and suppress cancer. The p53 protein thus functions in part by activating the expression of specific genes whose protein
products act to inhibit cellular growth (Figure 11.23a).
In addition however, p53 can also repress the expression of genes whose
protein products stimulate cellular growth (Figure 11.23b). Such repression takes place via a variety of mechanisms. For example, in different cases
p53 can bind to a target gene and prevent a transcriptional activator from
binding (Figure 11.24a, i) or promote the formation of a closed chromatin
structure incompatible with transcription (Figure 11.24a, ii). Similarly,
p53 can interact with specific transcriptional activators to stop them binding
to the DNA (Figure 11.24a, iii). In these cases therefore transcriptional
repression involves p53 targeting genes encoding growth stimulating proteins and inhibiting their expression (see Chapter 5, Section 5.3 for discussion of the mechanisms involved in transcriptional repression).
In other cases, however, p53 inhibits genes encoding growth stimulatory
proteins indirectly by inducing the expression of inhibitory proteins or RNAs
which then inhibit the target genes. Thus, for example, p53 can stimulate
the expression of the gene encoding the p21 inhibitor of cyclin-dependent
kinases (Figure 11.24b, i). As discussed below, the inactivation of cyclin-dependent kinases by p21 will allow the retinoblastoma protein to
remain in its active unphosphorylated form which then inhibits the expression of genes encoding growth stimulatory genes.
As well as stimulating the expression of protein-coding genes such as
the p21 gene, p53 can also inhibit gene expression by stimulating the

genes encoding growth stimulatory proteins (GSG) indirectly by stimulating
the expression of an inhibitory protein such as p21 (i), stimulating the
expression and processing of an miRna (ii), or stimulating the expression
of a long noncoding Rna (lncRna) (iii).

expression of inhibitory RNAs which then target the expression of growthenhancing proteins. In the case of miRNAs, p53 has been shown to stimulate the transcription of specific genes encoding miRNAs such as miR-34
and miR-192 as well as the processing of the initial transcript to the
mature miRNA by the Drosha protein (Figure 11.24b, ii) (see Chapter 7,
Section 7.7, for discussion of the regulation of miRNA processing). Such
miRNAs will then target specific genes, degrading their mRNAs and blocking their translation. Similarly, p53 can stimulate the expression of long
noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) which inhibit the expression of other target
genes (Figure 11.24b, iii) (see Chapter 1, Section 1.5, for general discussion of miRNAs and lncRNAs).
Hence, p53 can both stimulate the transcription of genes encoding
growth inhibitory genes and repress the expression of genes encoding
growth stimulatory genes, either acting on the target gene directly or via
inhibitory proteins and RNA molecules whose expression it induces. Clearly,
therefore the inactivation of p53 by gene deletion (Figure 11.25a) or by
mutation (Figure 11.25b), will lead to a failure to express growth inhibitory genes and overexpression of growth stimulatory genes, explaining why
loss of p53 produces cancer.
Although loss of p53 function by deletion of the gene or an inactivating
mutation can produce cancer, some p53 cancer-associated mutants appear
to have acquired an additional function which allows them to act as an
oncogene, with the mutant protein actually promoting tumor formation.
Such mutants can activate the expression of genes encoding growthpromoting genes even though they do not bind to the normal DNA-binding
site for wild-type p53. This may involve such mutant proteins binding to a
different DNA-binding site in growth-promoting genes (Figure 11.26a) or
the mutant p53 being recruited to the gene by a protein–protein interaction
with other DNA-binding transcription factors (Figure 11.26b).
As well as developing in the absence of wild-type p53 or in the presence
of mutant p53, cancer can also occur due to a failure of p53-mediated gene
activation even in the presence of functional p53 (Figure 11.25c). For
example, many human soft tissue sarcomas contain intact p53 protein but
have amplified the cellular mdm2 oncogene. The MDM2 oncoprotein binds
to p53 and promotes its modification by the addition of ubiquitin.
Interestingly, the addition of a single ubiquitin residue to p53 promotes its
export from the nucleus while the addition of two such residues promotes
its degradation. Either effect evidently prevents p53 activating its target
genes in the nucleus (Figure 11.27a).
As well as regulating the stability of p53, MDM2 also regulates the translation of the p53 mRNA. MDM2 interacts with the L26 ribosomal protein,
which normally binds to the p53 mRNA and stimulates its translation to
produce p53 protein. Binding of MDM2 to L26 prevents it binding to the p53
mRNA and thereby reduces p53 protein production (Figure 11.27b).
MDM2 can therefore inhibit p53 both by reducing the translation of its
mRNA and by inducing degradation of the p53 protein. Inhibition of p53 can
also be achieved by overexpression of the mdm4 oncogene which occurs in
many human tumors. In this case, however, the MDM4 protein inhibits p53
activity by binding to it and masking its transcriptional activation domain,
so preventing it activating transcription (see Chapter 5, Section 5.3 for discussion of this mechanism of transcriptional repression).

The interaction of p53 with oncogenic proteins is not unique to the
MDM2 and MDM4 cellular oncoproteins. As noted above, it was the interaction of p53 with the SV40 large T oncoprotein which led to the original
identification of the p53 protein. As in the case of the MDM2 and MDM4
proteins, the interaction of p53 with either the large T protein or the transforming proteins of several other DNA viruses prevents p53 from activating
its target genes. Such functional inactivation of p53 appears to play a critical
role in the ability of these viruses to transform cells to a cancerous phenotype. When taken together with the action of the MDM2 and MDM4 proteins, this indicates that functional interactions between oncogene and
tumor suppressor products are likely to be critical in the control of cellular
growth. Changes in this balance due to the overexpression of specific oncogenes or the loss of anti-oncogenes will result in cancer.

As well as being modified by ubiquitination, the activity of p53 is also
regulated by multiple post-translational modifications including phosphorylation, methylation, and acetylation. For example, the acetylation of p53 at
multiple lysine residues near its C-terminus prevents its interaction with
MDM2. This modification therefore stabilizes the p53. Moreover, such
acetylation of p53 also stimulates its ability to recruit the TAF1 component
of the TFIID basal transcription factor (see Chapter 4, Section 4.1), so
enhancing the ability of p53 to stimulate transcription (Figure 11.28).
The acetylation of p53 at its C-terminus leading to its activation is catalyzed by the p300 and CBP transcriptional co-activators which, as discussed in
Chapter 5 (Section 5.2), have histone acetyltransferase activity. In contrast, the
RAR–PML fusion protein found in promyelocytic leukemia (see Section 11.2)
can induce deacetylation of p53 thereby inhibiting its activity, providing an
example of the activity of an anti-oncogene being targeted by an oncogenic
fusion protein.
As indicated above, p53 can stimulate the expression of genes encoding
growth inhibitory proteins such as the p21 inhibitor of cyclin-dependent
kinases. In addition however, p53 also stimulates the expression of the
bax gene whose protein product stimulates programmed cell death or apoptosis. This supports a role for p53 in promoting the death of cells which
have become abnormal and can no longer divide normally.
It is likely therefore that p53 acts as a sensor for damage to cellular
DNA, for example by irradiation, which could result in mutations occurring. When it is activated, growth arrest genes are stimulated and
growth-stimulating genes are inhibited. The cell therefore ceases to divide
so that it can repair the damage. If the damage to the cell is irreparable,
however, genes inducing apoptosis are activated by p53 and the cell dies.
Evidently in the absence of p53, cells with DNA damage or mutations will
continue to replicate and if the mutations activate specific oncogenes then
a cancer will result (Figure 11.29).
Interestingly, acetylation of p53 on the lysine at position 120 in the central DNA-binding domain enhances its ability to induce expression of the
bax gene while having no effect on its ability to activate the p21 gene.
Hence, acetylation at this position has a distinct effect to that produced by
acetylation of the C-terminal region of p53 (see above). Moreover,

acetylation of p53 on the lysine at position

 TUMOR SUPPRESSOR TRANSCRIPTION FACTORS
modifying p53 in this way may allow cells to induce the cell death response
to elevated p53 levels rather than the growth arrest response (Figure 11.29).
Hence, the p53 gene product plays a key role in regulating cell division
and survival, acting by regulating the expression of specific target genes
involved in growth inhibition and cell death. Its inactivation by mutations or
by specific oncogene products is likely to play a critical role in the majority
of human cancers.
As well as these effects on growth inhibition and apoptosis, p53 can also
regulate cellular differentiation by modulating the expression of specific
genes. For example, activation of p53 in undifferentiated embryonic stem
cells (see Chapter 9, Section 9.1) induces their differentiation. This occurs
because p53 can repress the gene encoding the Nanog transcription factor,
which as described in Chapter 9 (Section 9.1), plays a key role in maintaining the pluripotent nature of ES cells and inhibiting their differentiation.
Hence, p53 can modulate the expression of genes involved in regulating
differentiation, as well as those involved in growth arrest or cell death
(Figure 11.30).
Interestingly, p53 also stimulates the expression of the gene encoding
MDM2, which as described above promotes p53 degradation and inhibits
p53 mRNA translation. This therefore constitutes a negative feedback loop
so that in normal cells, increases in p53 levels will induce MDM2 production
which in turn will down-regulate p53 (Figure 11.30).
Although p53 was initially believed to be a unique protein unrelated to
any others, two proteins which are related to p53 have been identified and
named p63 and p73 on the basis of their molecular weights. Both of these
proteins have been shown to be required for cellular differentiation and
normal development as well as being involved in cancer. For example, loss
or mutation of p63 leads to the human disease known as EEC syndrome
(ectrodactyly, ectodermal dysplasia, and cleft lip) in which patients have
limb defects and facial clefts. Similarly, p63 has been shown to function as
a tumor suppressor in epithelial cells.

By regulating the expression of its target

can enhance cellular growth, death, and

p53 is known to regulate multiple genes
involved in each process. in addition, p53
stimulates expression of the gene encoding
MdM2, which then inhibits p53 synthesis
and promotes its degradation in a negative
feedback loop.

The retinoblastoma protein interacts with other proteins to
regulate transcription
The retinoblastoma gene (Rb-1) was the first tumor suppressor gene to be
identified. This was on the basis that its inactivation results in the formation
of eye tumors known as retinoblastomas. As with p53, the Rb-1 protein acts
as a tumor suppressor gene by regulating the expression of specific target
genes. Unlike p53 however, it appears to act primarily via protein–protein
interactions with other transcription factors.
In particular, Rb-1 has been shown to interact with the cellular transcription factor E2F. E2F normally stimulates the transcription of several
growth-promoting genes such as the cellular oncogenes c-myc and c-myb
(see Sections 11.1 and 11.2) and the genes encoding DNA polymerase α and
thymidine kinase. The interaction of Rb-1 with E2F does not affect the ability of E2F to bind to its target sites in the DNA but prevents it stimulating
transcription. This is due to Rb-1 binding to the transcriptional activation
domain of E2F and blocking its activity via a quenching-type mechanism
(Figure 11.31) (see Chapter 5, Section 5.3 for discussion of this mechanism of transcriptional repression).
In addition however, it has been shown that Rb-1 can bind to both histone deacetylases and histone methylases and thereby promote histone

408

Chapter 11: Gene Regulation and Cancer

deacetylation and methylation. As discussed in Chapter 3 (Section 3.3),
both these modifications promote a more closed chromatin structure
incompatible with transcription, thereby blocking E2F-induced transcription (Figure 11.31). Interestingly, Rb proteins have also been shown to
interact with condensin proteins, which play a key role in the final stages of
chromatin condensation to form the mitotic chromosome (see Chapter 2,
Section 2.5). This suggests that Rb proteins may also regulate this level of
chromatin structure.
Rb-1 can therefore block the action of E2F both by inhibiting its ability to
activate transcription and via promoting a closed chromatin structure
(Figure 11.31). Hence Rb-1 acts as a tumor suppressor protein by preventing
the transcription of several growth-promoting genes, including oncogenes
such as c-myc which themselves encode transcription factors.
During the normal cell cycle of dividing cells, the Rb-1 protein becomes
phosphorylated by cyclin-dependent kinases. This prevents its interacting with
E2F, allowing the E2F factor to activate the growth-promoting genes whose
protein products are necessary for cell cycle progression (Figure 11.32a).
Such an effect can also be achieved by the deletion of the Rb-1 gene or its
inactivation by mutation which prevents the production of a functional Rb-1
protein (Figure 11.32b). Similarly, it is also possible for such an absence of
functional Rb-1 protein to arise from transcriptional inactivation of an intact
Rb-1 gene. For example in one study, 6 of 77 retinoblastomas were found to
have a heavily methylated Rb-1 gene which would result in a failure of its
transcription (see Chapter 3, Section 3.2) even though the gene itself was theoretically capable of encoding a functional protein.
As with the p53 protein, the Rb-1 protein can be inactivated by protein–
protein interaction with the oncogene products of DNA tumor viruses,
such as the SV40 T antigen, the adenovirus E1A protein or the E7 protein of
human papilloma viruses. In this case, however, the association of the viral
protein with Rb-1 dissociates the Rb-1–E2F complex, releasing free E2F
which can then activate gene expression (Figure 11.32c). In contrast, the
large DNA virus cytomegalovirus encodes a protein known as UL97, which
phosphorylates Rb-1, thereby mimicking the manner in which it is inactivated in the normal cell cycle.
The Rb-1 protein therefore plays a critical role in cellular growth regulation, modulating the expression of specific oncogenes and acting as a target
for the transforming oncoproteins of specific viruses. Interestingly, Rb-1 has
also been shown to interact with the RNA polymerase I transcription factor
UBF (see Chapter 4, Section 4.1) and thereby repress the transcription of the
genes encoding ribosomal RNA. In addition, it can also repress the transcription of the 5S rRNA and tRNA genes by RNA polymerase III (see Chapter
4, Section 4.1) by interacting with TFIIIB.

 TUMOR SUPPRESSOR TRANSCRIPTION FACTORS
FIGURE 11.33
By binding to the polymerase i transcription factor uBF, the
polymerase ii transcription factor e2F, and the polymerase iii
transcription factor tFiiiB, Rb can repress transcription of the
ribosomal Rna genes by Rna polymerase i, the transcription of e2Fdependent genes by Rna polymerase ii, and the transcription of the
tRna and 5S rRna genes by Rna polymerase iii.

Since transcription of the RNAs involved in protein synthesis is evidently
necessary for cellular growth, Rb-1 can act as a global inhibitor of cellular
growth by preventing the transcription of all the genes transcribed by RNA
polymerases I and III as well as blocking transcription by RNA polymerase II
of specific genes essential for growth (Figure 11.33).
Unlike the case with p53 (see above), mice lacking Rb-1 are not viable,
indicating that Rb-1 function is essential for normal development.
Interestingly, mice lacking Rb-1 can be rescued by also inactivating the gene
encoding the Id2 factor, an inhibitory member of the helix-loop-helix family
of transcription factors discussed in Chapter 5 (Section 5.1).
This indicates that Rb-1 and Id2 are likely to have antagonistic functions
so that inactivating one factor minimizes the effect of inactivating the
other. Indeed, it has been shown that Rb-1 and Id2 interact with one
another, resulting in the inhibition of Rb-1 activity. In tumor cells overexpressing the N-myc oncogene transcription factor (see Section 11.1), the
Id2 gene is transcriptionally activated by N-myc. The excess Id2 binds to
Rb-1 and inactivates it, allowing the tumor to grow. This therefore represents another example of oncogenes and tumor suppressor genes interacting antagonistically to regulate cellular growth, with the overexpression of
an oncogene protein resulting in the inactivation of a tumor suppressor
protein.
Together with p53 therefore Rb-1 plays a key role in restraining cellular
growth. Indeed many parallels exist between these two proteins. For example, as well as being regulated by tumor virus proteins, Rb-1 like p53 is
inhibited by interaction with the MDM2 protein. Moreover, acetylation of
Rb-1 enhances its interaction with MDM2, indicating that both p53 and Rb-1
can be regulated via phosphorylation and acetylation.
In addition, there is evidence that the p53 and Rb-1 pathways interact
with one another. The phosphorylation of Rb-1, which regulates its activity,
is carried out by the cyclin-dependent kinases. Hence, the action of p53
which stimulates the gene encoding the p21 inhibitor of these kinases (see
above), will reduce their activity and hence maintain Rb-1 in its nonphosphorylated growth inhibitory form (Figure 11.34).
Interestingly, the regulation of Rb activity during the cell cycle also parallels the regulation of the Whi5 factor in the yeast cell cycle by cyclindependent kinases, which was discussed in Chapter 10 (Section 10.3). In
turn, Whi5 inhibits the transcriptional activator SBF in yeast, paralleling the
inhibition of E2F by Rb-1 in mammalian cells (Figure 11.35).

Other tumor suppressor proteins also regulate transcription
In addition to p53, Rb-1, and the Wilms’ tumor gene product, it is clear that
other tumor suppressor genes also encode transcription factors. For example, the products of the BRCA-1 and BRCA-2 genes which are mutated in
many cases of breast cancer appear to act primarily by regulating the rate at
which damaged DNA is repaired. However, it appears that they can also
regulate transcription. BRCA-1 can, for example, interact with both p53 and
Rb-1 to regulate their activity. Moreover, BRCA-1 has been shown to interact with the C-terminal domain of the RPB1 subunit of RNA polymerase II
and modulate its phosphorylation, which is critical for transcriptional elongation (for discussion of this phosphorylation event and its role in transcriptional elongation see Chapter 4, Section 4.2).
BRCA-1 has also been shown to regulate the expression of the gene
encoding the microRNA miR-155. Thus BRCA-1 binds to the miR-155

gene promoter and recruits the HDAC2 histone deacetylase. This results
in histone deacetylation and the organization of a tightly packed chromatin structure incompatible with transcription of the miRNA-155 gene
(Figure 11.36). Cancer-causing mutations in BRCA-1 result in a loss of
the ability to repress miRNA-155, suggesting that the ability to do this is
important for the tumor suppressor activity of BRCA-1. In agreement with
this, artificial overexpression of miR-155 accelerates tumor cell growth
while inhibition of its expression has the opposite effects.
The process of transcriptional elongation which is regulated by BRCA-1
(see above) is also targeted by the von Hippel-Lindau (VHL) anti-oncogene
protein. VHL is part of a protein complex which adds the small protein

ubiquitin to the phosphorylated form of RNA polymerase II. As ubiquitination targets proteins for degradation (see also Chapter 8, Section 8.3), this
results in degradation of the polymerase. Moreover, since the phosphorylated form of RNA polymerase II is involved in transcriptional elongation
(see Chapter 4, Section 4.2), the VHL protein specifically targets this process. Interestingly, miR-155 (whose expression is repressed by BRCA-1, see
above) has been shown to down-regulate VHL expression, providing a further link between BRCA-1 and VHL.
As discussed in Chapter 8 (Section 8.3), VHL is also involved in the degradation of the HIF-1α protein, which plays a key role in the induction of
gene expression in response to hypoxia. Hence, VHL regulates diverse cellular processes.
Both these processes, however, are likely to play a role in the cancers
which develop when VHL is inactivated. The mutant forms of VHL which
are found in cancers do not inhibit transcriptional elongation, indicating
that this effect is important in cancer development. This is likely to be due
to the fact that several cellular oncogenes, such as c-myc and c-fos are regulated at the level of transcription elongation (see Chapter 5, Section 5.4).
Hence, in the absence of VHL these factors will be overproduced since the
block to productive elongation of their RNA transcripts will be abolished
(Figure 11.37).
Similarly, the enhanced HIF-1 activity in the absence of VHL will assist
tumor growth, since it will induce expression of genes which are normally
only induced under hypoxic conditions. These include, for example, genes
involved in blood vessel formation, so enhancing the blood supply to the
tumor and stimulating its growth (Figure 11.37).
The vital role of p53, Rb-1, and the other tumor suppressor products
indicates that, although discovered later than the oncogenes, the tumor suppressor genes are likely to play as critical a role in regulating cellular growth
in general and the pattern of gene expression in particular. Hence, the precise rate of cellular growth is likely to be controlled by the balance between
interacting oncogene and tumor suppressor gene products, with cancer
resulting from a change in this balance by activation/overexpression of
oncogenes or inactivation/reduced expression of tumor suppressor genes.
The oncogenes and tumor suppressor genes described, respectively, in
Section 11.2 and this section encode DNA-binding transcription factors or
factors such as Rb-1 which interact with DNA-binding factors to regulate
their activity. It is now clear however, that cancer can also involve alteration in other aspects of gene regulation, notably chromatin structure,
post-transcriptional processes, and regulatory RNAs. These three aspects
are discussed in the next three sections of this chapter.

Chapter 11: Gene Regulation and Cancer

11.4 ThE EpIGENOME AND CANCER
As described in Chapter 3, the existence of a genome DNA sequence
which is generally identical in different cells of the same individual is
paralleled by the existence of an epigenome in which alterations in histone modifications, DNA methylation, and nucleosome positioning can
occur in different cell types and under different conditions. In view of the
critical role that such epigenetic changes play in normal chromatin structure and gene regulation, it is not surprising that alterations in histone
modifications, DNA methylation or nucleosome positioning can play a key
role in cancer, and each of these aspects will be discussed in turn in this
section.

Oncogenic and tumor suppressor proteins can modulate
chromatin structure
In earlier sections of this chapter we have noted examples of how oncogenic and tumor suppressor proteins can modulate chromatin structure.
Thus, one mechanism by which the Rb-1 tumor suppressor protein repressed
E2F-dependent gene expression was by promoting histone deacetylation
and methylation, so organizing a tightly packed chromatin structure incompatible with the transcription of E2F-dependent genes (see Section 11.3 and
Figure 11.31).
Similarly, as discussed in Section 11.2, the RAR–PML and AML–ETO
fusion proteins produced by chromosomal translocations in specific human
leukemias achieve their oncogenic effect by recruiting histone deacetylase
enzymes, which results in a tightly packed chromatin structure incompatible with transcription (see Figure 11.20). Although both these fusion proteins affect histone acetylation, other histone modifications such as histone
methylation (see Chapter 3, Section 3.3) can also be affected by oncogenic
fusion proteins.
An example of these effects is provided by the MLL factor which was
identified on the basis of its involvement in the chromosomal translocations
which occur in human mixed lineage leukemias (MLL). Such translocations
lead to the production of fusion proteins of MLL linked to other factors.
Several of these fusion proteins can recruit the histone methyltransferase
enzyme DOTIL, which then methylates histone H3 on lysine 79. In turn, this
produces a more open chromatin structure of genes whose protein products
are involved in growth stimulation and the development of leukemia
(Figure 11.38).
Interestingly, the MLL protein is a human homolog of the trithorax proteins, originally identified in Drosophila (see Chapter 3, Section 3.3 and
Chapter 5, Section 5.1). Like the trithorax proteins, MLL functions to open
the chromatin structure of specific Hox genes encoding homeodomain factors during development. As described in Chapter 3 (Section 3.3) and
Chapter 5 (Section 5.1), the chromatin-opening action of trithorax proteins
is opposed by polycomb family proteins which act to produce a closed chromatin structure.
Such polycomb proteins are also involved in cancers. For example, the
EZH2 protein which is part of the PRC2 polycomb complex, is overexpressed
in several different cancers and appears to repress the transcription of a
number of tumor suppressor genes (which would otherwise inhibit tumor
formation, see Section 11.3) by methylating histone H3 on lysine 27. This
modification not only itself produces a closed chromatin structure, but in
cancer cells also promotes DNA methylation, further promoting tight packing of chromatin (Figure 11.39).
Alterations in histone modifications therefore play a key role in cancer,
with both oncogenic and tumor suppressor proteins being able to alter the
pattern of such modifications at their target genes. Interestingly, it has been
shown that the gene encoding the histone variant H3.3 is mutated in several
different childhood tumors, suggesting that alterations in specific histone
variants can also play a role in specific cancers (see Chapter 2, Section 2.3
for discussion of histone variants).

Alterations in DNA methylation patterns play
an important role in cancer
In view of the close relationship between histone modifications and DNA
methylation (see Chapter 3, Section 3.4) it is not surprising that, as well as
altered patterns of histone modification, alterations in DNA methylation
patterns also occur in cancer. Indeed, as noted above, the effect of the
oncogenic EZH2 protein on histone modification is accompanied by
enhanced DNA methylation.
In the earlier stages of many human cancers, DNA methyltransferase
enzymes produce enhanced DNA methylation at the promoters of various
tumor suppressor genes, thereby inhibiting their expression (Figure 11.40a).
This effect is observed, for example, for the gene encoding the Rb-1
protein in a number of different retinoblastomas, as discussed in
Section 11.3. Interestingly however, later in the development of the tumor,
decreased DNA methylation by DNA methyltransferase enzymes occurs at
the promoters of various oncogenes, thereby activating their expression
(Figure 11.40b).

Antagonism of polycomb-mediated

Clearly therefore, both enhanced and reduced DNA methylation occur in
cancer and play a critical role in its progressive development. In agreement
with this, mutations in DNA methyltransferase enzymes have been shown
to occur in human cancers with, for example, mutation of the gene encoding the DNMT3A enzyme being observed in 20% of individuals with acute
myeloid leukemia (see Chapter 3, Section 3.2 for discussion of this DNA
methyltransferase enzyme).

Components of nucleosome remodeling complexes are mutated
in different human cancers
As discussed in Chapter 2 (Section 2.2) and Chapter 3 (Section 3.5) chromatin remodeling complexes play a key role in the regulation of nucleosome
positioning and hence in chromatin structure. A wide variety of components of such complexes have been shown to be mutated in human cancers
and both oncogenic and tumor suppressor effects have been reported in
different cases.
For example, mutations in components of the SWI/SNF remodeling
complexes have been detected in human cancers including lung, breast,
pancreatic, and prostate cancers. Generally the effects of these mutations
suggest that the SWI/SNF has a tumor suppressor effect when unmutated.
Indeed, this tumor suppressor effect can be explained mechanistically
by a number of different properties of the complex. For example, the
SWI/SNF complex has been shown to be able to repress expression of
the myc oncogene (Figure 11.41a), to mimic the inhibitory effect of the
Rb-1 tumor suppressor protein on the activity of E2F-dependent genes
(Figure 11.41b), and to antagonize the pro-oncogenic activity of the
polycomb complex by opening rather than closing the chromatin of specific target genes (Figure 11.41c).
When taken together with the effects of histone modifications and DNA
methylation discussed above, the role in cancer of nucleosome remodeling
complexes clearly indicates the vital role of alterations in the epigenome in
cancer development complementing and interacting with the effects of
DNA-binding proteins, which was discussed in Sections 11.1 and 11.2.

11.5 P

pOST-TRANSCRIpTIONAL pROCESSES
AND CANCER

As well as alterations in transcription of specific genes caused by changes in
the epigenome/chromatin structure or in transcription factors, cancer frequently involves changes in the post-transcriptional processes discussed in
Chapters 6 and 7 and these will be discussed in this section.

Alterations in mRNA translation in cancer can be produced
by enhancing the activity of RNA polymerases I and III
The enhanced growth of cancer cells will frequently require an increase in
the translation of many different mRNAs by the ribosome, so producing
the increased protein levels needed by the growing cells. One means of
doing this is to enhance the activity of RNA polymerases I and III which
transcribe the genes encoding key components of the translational apparatus such as the ribosomal RNAs and transfer RNAs (see Chapter 6,
Section 6.6 and Chapter 7, Section 7.6 for discussion of mRNA translation
and its regulation).

FIGURE 11.41
the tumor suppressor effect of the SWi/SnF
chromatin remodeling complex involves its
ability to inhibit expression of the myc gene
(a), to inhibit e2F-dependent gene expression
(b) and to antagonize polycomb-mediated
chromatin closing (c).

415

POST-TRANSCRIPTIONAL PROCESSES AND CANCER
Indeed, as well as regulating the transcription of protein-coding genes by
RNA polymerase II, oncogenes and tumor suppressor genes can also regulate the transcription of ribosomal RNA and transfer RNA genes by RNA
polymerases I and III. For example, as described in Section 11.3, the Rb-1
anti-oncogene protein can repress the transcription of the ribosomal RNA
genes by interacting with the UBF RNA polymerase I transcription factor. It
can also repress the transcription of the tRNA and 5S ribosomal RNA genes
by interacting with the TFIIIB RNA polymerase III transcription factor
(see Figure 11.33) (see Chapter 4, Section 4.1 for discussion of transcription
by RNA polymerases I and III).
Interestingly, p53 also represses transcription by RNA polymerases I and
III whereas in contrast the c-Myc oncogene protein stimulates transcription
by both these polymerases. Hence, tumor suppressor proteins can restrain
cellular growth by limiting the production of RNAs required for protein synthesis, while oncogenic proteins have the reverse effect and therefore stimulate cellular growth (Figure 11.42).
Although p53, Rb-1, and c-Myc produce their different effects on RNA
polymerase III transcription by interacting with TFIIIB, they do not all
interact with the same components of the multiprotein TFIIIB complex. As
described in Chapter 4 (Section 4.1), TFIIIB is a multiprotein complex
composed of the TBP factor and two other proteins, Bdp1 and Brf1. Rb-1
and c-Myc both interact with the Brf1 component of TFIIIB to respectively
reduce or enhance its activity, whereas p53 interacts with TBP itself
(Figure 11.42).
As expected from this model, overexpression of Brf1 in cells results in
their transformation into tumor cells, indicating that Brf1 can act as an
oncogene when overexpressed. This effect of Brf1 can be mimicked by
overexpression of the initiator tRNA for methionine whose role is to insert
the initial methionine amino acid with which protein synthesis begins
(see Chapter 6, Section 6.6). This demonstrates that, as well as proteins, a
tRNA can act as an oncogene when overexpressed. Moreover, it indicates
that the effect of Brf1 on cellular transformation is likely to be dependent
upon its ability to enhance RNA polymerase III-mediated transcription of
the gene encoding the initiator tRNA for methionine (Figure 11.43).

to inhibit its activity and therefore reduce
Rna polymerase iii transcription. in contrast
the oncogenic protein c-Myc interacts with
the Brf1 component of tFiiiB to enhance
its activity and therefore increase Rna
polymerase iii transcription.

Alterations in mRNA translation in cancer can be produced
directly by changes in ribosomal proteins
The findings described above suggest that the initiation of mRNA translation
is a key regulatory point in controlling cellular growth and tumor formation.
Clearly, changes in mRNA translation in cancer could also be produced by
direct effects on components of the ribosome rather than by indirect effects
involving stimulation of RNA polymerases I and III. In agreement with this
idea, overexpression of the translation initiation factor eIF4E (see Chapter 6,
Section 6.6) can transform normal cells into cancer cells.
As described in Chapter 7 (Section 7.6) the activity of eIF4E is regulated
by the eIF4E-binding protein (eIF4Ebp), which binds to eIF4E and prevents
it binding the translation initiation factors, eIF4A and eIF4G. Inhibition of
eIF4E by eIF4Ebp has a particularly severe effect on the translation of mRNAs
with secondary structure in their 5′ region. Thus, eIF4A is required to unfold
this secondary structure and allow the ribosome to move along the mRNA
from the 5′ cap to the initiator methionine codon (see Figure 7.50). RNAs of
this type include a number encoding proteins involved in cellular growth,
including the mRNAs encoding c-Myc and cyclin D1. For this reason, eIF4E
or eIF4A, which promote translation of these mRNAs, can act as oncogenes
when overexpressed whereas eIF4Ebp, which inhibits this effect, acts as a
tumor suppressor when overexpressed.
It has been shown that eIF4Ebp is phosphorylated in growing cells and in
a number of human tumors, with such phosphorylation decreasing its ability
to bind to eIF4E and thereby releasing eIF4E from inhibition by eIF4Ebp.
Such phosphorylation is produced by the PI3-kinase/Akt/TOR kinase cascade, which was discussed in Chapter 8 (Section 8.6) (Figure 11.44).

Chapter 11: Gene Regulation and Cancer

As well as phosphorylating eIF4Ebp, the PI3-kinase/Akt/TOR pathway
also phosphorylates a number of other factors so as to enhance mRNA
translation. As described in Chapter 8 (Section 8.6), these include proteins
involved in regulating transcription by RNA polymerases I and III, as well as
the S6 protein kinase which in turn phosphorylates other factors involved in
mRNA translation.
One of the factors phosphorylated by the PI3-kinase/Akt/TOR pathway
is the Brf1 component of TFIIIB (see above). This promotes its association
with TBP, so enhancing the activity of TFIIIB and RNA polymerase IIIdependent transcription. The PI3-kinase/Akt/TOR pathway can therefore
stimulate translation both by inhibiting the activity of the anti-oncogenic
eIF4Ebp and by enhancing the activity of the Brf1 protein, which as described
above has oncogenic activity when overexpressed (Figure 11.45).
In view of these effects of the PI3-kinase/Akt/TOR pathway, it is not
surprising that the different components of this kinase cascade can themselves act as oncogenes when overexpressed (Figure 11.45). Conversely, the
PTEN phosphatase protein, which is a tumor suppressor mutated in a wide
variety of human cancers, produces its anti-oncogenic effect by antagonizing PI3-kinase (Figure 11.45).
Hence, the regulation of translation itself and of transcription by the RNA
polymerases which produce the RNAs involved in it, plays a key role in regulating cellular growth and can produce cancer when different regulatory
factors are overexpressed or mutated.

Other post-transcriptional processes are also involved in cancer
Although alteration in the process of mRNA translation is the posttranscriptional stage which has been best characterized in cancer, alterations in other post-transcriptional events have also been shown to be
involved in the development of cancer.
For example, it is not surprising in view of the widespread use of alternative splicing (see Chapter 7, Section 7.1) that this process is frequently
altered in cancer. The best characterized case involves the SRSF1 protein,
a member of the SR family of RNA-binding proteins (see Chapter 6, Section
6.3 for discussion of this family). This protein has been shown to function as
an oncogene whose overexpression can produce cancer. This occurs, at
least in part, because overexpression of SRSF1 promotes the alternative
splicing of the RNA encoding the S6K1 regulator of mRNA translation to
produce a truncated protein with oncogenic activity. Moreover, overexpression of SRSF1 also results in the alternative splicing of the RNA encoding
the BIN1 tumor suppressor which produces an isoform that lacks tumor
suppressor activity. Hence, SRSF1 can promote the alternative splicing of
the RNA encoding one protein to produce an oncogenic form, while stimulating the alternative splicing of the RNA encoding another protein to produce a non-tumor suppressor form (Figure 11.46).
Interestingly, the alteration of the process of A to I RNA editing
(see Chapter 7, Section 7.3) has also been shown to be involved in cancer.
One such case involves the increased editing of the RNA encoding antizyme
inhibitor one (AZIN1) which has been shown to occur in liver cancers.
This produces a form of the protein which binds with increased affinity
to its target, the antizyme one (AZN1) protein. In turn, this prevents
AZN1 from binding to the growth-stimulating proteins cyclin D1 and
ornithine decarboxylase. As such antizyme binding would normally result

pathway. Potential oncogenes are shown in pink and anti-oncogenes in blue.

in the degradation of these proteins, inhibition of binding results in

11.6 REGULATORY RNAs AND CANCER
As discussed in Chapter 1 (Section 1.5) and throughout this book, small
microRNAs (miRNAs) and long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) play a key role in
many different cellular processes by regulating the expression of proteincoding genes. It is not surprising therefore that both miRNAs and lncRNAs
have been shown to be involved in specific cancers and to play a key role in
their development. The role of these two classes of regulatory RNAs will
therefore be discussed in turn.

aZin1 protein produces a form of the protein
with enhanced binding affinity for the aZn1
protein. this prevents aZn1 binding to
growth stimulatory proteins such as cyclin
d1 (Cdi) and promoting their degradation.
in turn, this enhances the levels of growth
stimulatory proteins so stimulating cellular
growth.

Chapter 11: Gene Regulation and Cancer

Different miRNAs can act to promote or inhibit cancer
development
As discussed in Section 11.3, the tumor suppressor p53 can activate transcription of the genes encoding specific miRNAs such as miR-34 and
miR-192. This suggests that the expression of specific miRNAs may inhibit
cancer development so that the loss of their expression due to loss or mutation of a tumor suppressor gene results in cancer.
In agreement with this idea B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL),
the most frequent adult leukemia in the western world, has been shown to
be caused by the deletion of a region of chromosome 13 which contains the
genes encoding the miRNAs, miR-15a and miR-16-1 (Figure 11.48a).
Cancer can therefore result from the loss of genes encoding specific miRNAs
which act as tumor suppressors by restraining cellular growth.
Interestingly, in human epithelial ovarian cancer expression of a number
of different miRNAs is down-regulated. Approximately 15% of these effects
are due to deletion of the gene encoding the miRNA, while 36% involve the
miRNA gene being packaged into a closed chromatin structure due to
enhanced DNA methylation and/or decreased histone acetylation (see
Chapter 3, Sections 3.2 and 3.3 and Section 11.4 of this chapter for discussion of the effect of these modifications on chromatin structure and their
role in cancer). Hence, down-regulation of miRNAs in human tumors can
arise from gene deletion (Figure 11.48a) or decreased transcription due to
altered chromatin structure (Figure 11.48b).
As well as changes in chromatin structure, reduced miRNA expression
can also occur due to decreased transcription of miRNA-encoding genes
produced by oncogenic transcription factors (Figure 11.48c). For example,
it has been shown that the genes encoding the let-7 and miR-34a miRNAs
are transcriptionally repressed by the c-Myc oncogene protein.
Down-regulation of miRNAs in human tumors can also result from the
loss of activation of their corresponding genes by tumor suppressors
(Figure 11.48d). For example, as discussed above (Section 11.3) p53 can
activate the expression of the gene encoding miR-34. In turn, this miRNA
post-transcriptionally inhibits the expression of the genes encoding the
growth promoting protein CDK6 and the survival-promoting protein Bcl-2.
Hence, loss of miR-34 expression caused by loss or mutation of p53 will
promote cellular growth and the survival of abnormal cells.
Multiple mechanisms therefore operate in human tumors to downregulate the transcription of genes encoding miRNAs which inhibit cancer
development. In turn, such a decrease in the level of specific miRNAs will
result in an increase in the expression of the protein-coding genes which
they normally regulate. For example, genes which are normally downregulated by the let-7 miRNA include the c-Myc and c-Ras oncogenes and
the Hmga2 chromatin-remodeling protein (Figure 11.49). Similarly, deletion of the gene encoding the miR-101 miRNA produces overexpression of
the oncogenic polycomb protein EZH2 (see Section 11.4), while as discussed above loss of miR-34 expression due to loss of p53 will enhance the
expression of the oncogenic CDK6 and Bcl-2 proteins.
Although down-regulation of specific miRNAs therefore plays a key
role in different human tumors, other miRNAs which can stimulate

Figure 11.48.

cellular growth are up-regulated in human cancers. For example, the gene
locus encoding the miR-17-92 cluster of miRNAs is amplified at the DNA
level in several types of lymphomas and solid tumors, resulting in the
overexpression of miR-17-92 microRNAs in these tumors. In turn, miR-17-92
post-transcriptionally inhibits the expression of the gene encoding the
PTEN tumor suppressor (see Section 11.5).
Interestingly, the transcription of the gene encoding miR-17-92 is also activated by both c-Myc and E2F. Similarly, as described in Section 11.3, mutation
of the BRCA-1 tumor suppressor can relieve its normal inhibitory effect on
expression of miR-155, thereby enhancing the expression of this growth stimulatory miRNA. Hence, the overexpression of genes encoding miRNAs can be
achieved by DNA amplification (Figure 11.50a), transcriptional activation by
an oncogene (Figure 11.50b), or loss of transcriptional repression by a tumor
suppressor (Figure 11.50c). This parallels the multiple mechanisms producing reduced expression of other miRNA genes in human tumors. Moreover,
the c-Myc oncogene protein can transcriptionally activate or repress the genes
encoding different miRNAs (compare Figures 11.48 and 11.50).
As well as stimulating the expression of tumor suppressor miRNAs (see
above) p53 is also a target for post-transcriptional repression by miRNAs
such as miR-380 and miR-504. Overexpression of these miRNAs therefore
stimulates tumor growth by inhibiting p53 expression. Hence, p53 both
regulates genes encoding miRNAs and is a target for inhibition by other
miRNAs (Figure 11.51).

Different lncRNAs can both promote or inhibit cancer
development
As discussed in Chapter 1 (Section 1.5), lncRNAs can regulate gene expression by a variety of mechanisms and different lncRNAs have been shown to
stimulate or inhibit cancer cell growth.

Chapter 11: Gene Regulation and Cancer

For example, the lncRNA SChLAP1 is frequently overexpressed in
human prostate cancer. It has been shown to stimulate prostate cancer
cell growth by inhibiting the activity of the SNF5 component of the
SWI/SNF chromatin-remodeling complex. As described above (Section 11.4)
the SWI/SNF complex has a tumor suppressor effect and so its inactivation by inhibition of one of its subunits enhances cancer cell growth
(Figure 11.52).
As well as acting as an oncogene, as in this example, lncRNAs can also
act as tumor suppressors. An interesting example of this involves an
interaction between an lncRNA and miRNAs. Thus, the PTEN tumor suppressor protein (see Section 11.5) is normally targeted by several inhibitory miRNAs which bind to the 3′ untranslated region of the PTEN mRNA.
However, the genome also contains a PTEN-related gene, known as
PTENP1 (PTEN pseudogene 1). Although this gene cannot encode a functional PTEN protein (and is therefore classified as a pseudogene), it is
transcribed to produce an lncRNA and the 3′ untranslated region of this
RNA can compete with that of the PTEN RNA for binding of inhibitory
miRNAs. This lncRNA therefore acts as a decoy for miRNAs, relieving the
post-transcriptional repression of PTEN (see Chapter 7, Section 7.7, for
general discussion of this method of regulating miRNA activity). In agreement with this, deletion of the PTENP1 pseudogene is observed in human
colon and breast cancer which as a consequence show reduced PTEN
expression (Figure 11.53).
Overall therefore, as with proteins, specific miRNAs and lncRNAs can act
as oncogenes stimulating cellular growth and cancer while other miRNAs
and lncRNAs can act as tumor suppressors restraining cellular growth and
cancer. Moreover, a complex regulatory network exists, with miRNAs
and lncRNAs interacting with one another to regulate the expression of

KEY CONCEPTS
protein-coding genes which in turn can regulate the expression of the
genes encoding these RNAs.

CONCLUSIONS
The malregulation of gene expression plays a central role in human cancer,
paralleling the critical role that gene control processes play in the regulation
of normal cellular growth. At one level, such malregulation involves the
increased expression of a cellular oncogene or the decreased expression of
a tumor suppressor encoding growth regulatory proteins. This parallels the
manner in which cancer can also be caused by mutations that produce
altered forms of oncogenic or tumor suppressor proteins.
At another level, however, some of the oncogenic or tumor suppressor
proteins which exhibit altered expression or mutation are themselves gene
regulatory proteins able to control the expression of other target genes
whose protein products are involved in cellular growth. Hence, their altered
expression or mutation will alter the expression of a number of other
genes. This can occur where the oncogene or tumor suppressor encodes a
transcription factor able to regulate transcription of genes by one or more
RNA polymerases. Similarly, oncogenes or tumor suppressor genes may
encode proteins which modulate chromatin structure by altering histone
modifications or DNA methylation or by directly remodeling chromatin
structure.
As well as alterations in transcription, these effects can occur posttranscriptionally via oncogenic or tumor suppressor factors encoding proteins involved in mRNA translation or targeting other post-transcriptional
events. Similarly, as in so many other biological processes discussed in this
book, oncogenic or tumor suppressor effects can be achieved by small
miRNAs or larger lncRNAs.
Clearly, different oncogenic or tumor suppressor effects will be of different importance in various cancers, with the development and progression
of most human cancers involving a multi-step process, with activation of
one or more oncogenes and inhibition of one or more tumor suppressor
genes. Moreover, these processes interact with one another, with the
expression and/or activity of oncogenic or tumor suppressor proteins
involved in gene regulation being themselves regulated by the products of
other oncogenes or tumor suppressor genes.
Overall therefore, the study of gene regulation in cancer offers insights
into the nature of the disease as well as the mechanisms by which gene
control processes regulate the growth of normal cells. However, alterations
in gene control processes occur in a wide variety of other human diseases
apart from cancer. The involvement of malregulation of gene expression in
these other human diseases is discussed in the next chapter, together with
the manner in which the artificial manipulation of gene expression may be
of benefit in specific human diseases including cancer.

KEY CONCEpTS

transcription factors which control the transcription of other genes
and thereby play a key role in regulating normal cellular growth
processes and in cancer.

•

As well as regulating the transcription of protein-coding genes by
RNA polymerase II, oncogenes and tumor suppressor genes can
also regulate transcription by RNA polymerases I and III.

•

Oncogenes and tumor suppressor genes can also regulate gene
expression post-transcriptionally by encoding proteins which can
affect post-transcriptional processes, such as alternative splicing,

Gene Regulation and Human
Disease
INTRODUCTION
The central role of gene control processes in normal cellular function which
has been discussed throughout this book makes it inevitable that abnormal­
ities in such processes will result in disease. In addition to the abnormalities
which occur in cancer (see Chapter 11), it has been demonstrated that many
human genetic diseases involve the inheritance of mutated genes encoding
proteins which regulate gene expression. A number of different diseases
have been shown to involve mutations in proteins involved in each of the
three fundamental processes that regulate gene expression (see Chapters
2–7), namely the processes of transcription itself, the regulation of chro­
matin structure which is necessary for transcription to occur, and post­
transcriptional processes. These cases will be discussed in Sections 12.1 to
12.3 of this chapter, respectively. Section 12.4 will describe the manner in
which abnormalities in regulatory RNAs are involved in human genetic dis­
eases and Section 12.5 will describe alterations in gene regulatory processes
that can occur in human infectious disease. Finally, it is clear that the
insights obtained by studies on gene regulation in cancer and other human
diseases may lead to the development of effective therapies for manipulat­
ing gene expression in these diseases and this is discussed in Section 12.6.

12.1 TRANSCRIPTION AND HUMAN DISEASE
A number of different elements involved in the process of transcription
and its control can be mutated in human disease and these will be dis­
cussed in turn.

(a)

DNA-binding transcription factors

In discussing human diseases caused by defects in specific transcription
factors, it should be noted that only gene mutations that are compatible with
life will manifest as human diseases, however severe these may be.
Mutations in factors that are incompatible with survival at least to birth will
evidently not be detected and it is likely that many mutations affecting gene
regulation fall into this category.
Nonetheless, a number of congenital diseases which are detectable at
birth or shortly after involve mutations in the genes encoding specific tran­
scription factors (Figure 12.1a). For example, mutations in individual
members of the PAX transcription factor family (see Chapter 5, Section 5.1),
such as Pax3 and Pax6, have been shown to be involved in a number of
congenital eye disorders. Similarly, mutations in the gene encoding the
Pit­1 member of the POU family of transcription factors (see Chapter 5,
Section 5.1) result in a failure of pituitary gland development and conse­
quent dwarfism in both mice and humans.

Mutations in Pit­1 and Pax6 are both dominant, with one single copy of
the mutant gene being sufficient to produce the disease even in the pres­
ence of a functional copy. However, this dominance arises for different rea­
sons. Thus, the mutant Pit­1 can bind to its DNA­binding site but cannot
activate gene expression. It therefore not only fails to stimulate transcrip­
tion of its target genes but can also act as a dominant negative factor inhib­
iting gene activation by preventing the wild­type protein from binding to
DNA (Figure 12.2a) (see Chapter 5, Section 5.3 for discussion of this mech­
anism of transcriptional repression).
In contrast, the dominant nature of the Pax6 mutation does not reflect
any dominant negative action of the mutant protein since such mutations
often involve complete deletion of the gene. Rather it is due to haploid
insufficiency in which the amount of protein produced by a single func­
tional copy of the gene is not enough to allow it to activate its target genes
effectively (Figure 12.2b).
Interestingly, although many diseases involving mutant transcription
factors show very early onset of symptoms, mutations in the MEF2A tran­
scription factor (see Chapter 10, Section 10.1) have been shown to produce
coronary artery disease in middle­aged patients. This indicates that muta­
tions in transcription factors can produce disease later in life as well as in
early development.
As well as such defects in the development or functioning of specific
organs, mutations in the genes encoding the members of the nuclear recep­
tor family (see Chapter 5, Section 5.1), can result in a failure to respond to
the specific hormone that normally binds to the receptor and thereby regu­
lates gene expression. For example, mutations in the gene encoding the
glucocorticoid receptor result in a syndrome of steroid resistance in which
the patients do not respond to glucocorticoid.
Interestingly, mutations in the peroxisome proliferator­activated recep­
tor gamma (PPARγ), which is also a member of the nuclear receptor family,
have been found in a few human individuals with insulin resistance leading
to type 2 diabetes. Although such cases are rare, they suggest that PPARγ

As well as involving mutations in DNA­binding transcription factors, spe­

which such factors bind, for example, promoter or enhancer elements
(Figure 12.3). An example of this was discussed in Chapter 9 (Section 9.3)

Mutations in an enhancer (e) located 25 kb upstream of the PTF1A gene
reduce expression of the gene, resulting in reduced levels of PTF1A
transcription factor (dotted lines). in turn, this will affect the expression
of genes regulated by PTF1A, resulting in the human disease pancreatic
agenesis.

of the gene encoding Sonic Hedgehog produces the human disease poly­

Similarly, mutations within an enhancer located 25 kb upstream of the
PTF1A gene cause human pancreatic agenesis in which the pancreas fails
to develop. Interestingly, the PTF1A gene itself encodes a basic helix­loop­
helix transcription factor (see Chapter 5, Section 5.1 for discussion of this
family of transcription factors), indicating that alterations in a regulatory
DNA sequence can affect the production of a transcription factor. In turn,
this will then produce abnormal expression of the target genes for this fac­
tor (Figure 12.4).
Although in these cases and a number of others, specific mutations have
a dramatic effect on gene expression and produce severe disease, in other
cases the effects of such DNA sequence changes can be more subtle, pro­
ducing a quantitative change in the level of gene transcription rather than
severely reducing or abolishing transcription (Figure 12.5). Thus, gene
chip analysis (see Chapter 1, Section 1.2) comparing the total RNA expres­
sion patterns in different normal human individuals has revealed quantita­
tive differences in the expression of many different RNAs, which correlate
with differences in the promoter or enhancer sequences of the correspond­
ing genes in the different individuals.
Rather than specifically causing a particular disease, such quantitative
variations in gene expression are likely to enhance or reduce the risk of
specific multifactorial diseases which develop due to the interaction of mul­
tiple genetic and environmental factors. For example, a recent whole
genome study found that approximately one in four DNA sequence varia­
tions associated with human autoimmune diseases were located in DNAse1
hypersensitive sites (see Chapter 3, Section 3.5), indicating that they were
within regions that bind transcription factors and regulate gene expression.

As well as affecting DNA­binding transcription factors or their DNA­binding
sites, specific mutations can also affect co­activators which, as described in

To function effectively the cell needs to have two intact genes encoding the CBP co-activator protein (a). specific diseases result when one
gene is inactive, resulting in reduced levels of CBP (b) or when CBP is intact but is sequestered by an abnormal Huntingtin protein (H) so
that it cannot fulfill its co-activator role (c).

Chapter 5 (Section 5.2), play a key role in the action of DNA­binding tran­
scriptional activators (Figure 12.1b). In particular, the CBP co­activator is
of vital importance in a number of different signaling pathways, linking the
transcription factor which is activated by the pathway to either the basal
transcriptional complex or altering chromatin structure. It is not surprising
therefore that mutations which result in individuals lacking functional CBP
are incompatible with life. Indeed, even having a single inactive CBP gene
while retaining a single functional gene results in the severe human dis­
ease, Rubinstein­Taybi syndrome, which is characterized by mental retarda­
tion and physical abnormalities.
Hence, even if a single CBP gene remains functional, the inactivation of
the second copy produces disease. This is likely to be due to the amount of
CBP in normal cells being low with various transcription factors competing
for it (see Chapter 5, Section 5.2 and Chapter 8, Section 8.1). Hence, the
reduction in the level of CBP due to loss of one gene copy results in disease
(Figure 12.6). The CBP gene mutation in Rubinstein­Taybi syndrome is
therefore dominant for the same reason as in the Pax6 case discussed
above, namely the inability of one functional gene copy to produce the
required amount of protein.
CBP can also be involved in disease processes even when it is intact
and unmutated. It has been shown that individuals with the neurodegen­
erative disease Huntington’s chorea produce an abnormal form of a protein
known as Huntingtin. In this disease, a CAG sequence in the coding
sequence of the Huntingtin protein has expanded producing a run of glu­
tamine amino acids (encoded by the CAG triplet) in the Huntingtin protein.
This abnormal form of Huntingtin binds to the normal CBP protein and
prevents it from regulating transcription by depositing it in insoluble
aggregates (Figure 12.6). As well as binding to CBP, mutant Huntingtin has
also been shown to interfere with the functioning of the Sp1 transcription
factor and the TBP component of the basal transcriptional complex, indi­
cating that it can disrupt the function of different classes of transcriptional
regulators (Figure 12.7).

Components of the basal transcriptional complex

The effect of Huntingtin on TBP described above indicates the ability of
disease processes to disrupt the functioning of the basal transcriptional
complex, which is one of the major targets for activators and co­activators
(see Chapter 5, Section 5.2). However, given the critical role for this com­
plex (see Chapter 4, Section 4.1), it is likely that most mutations in compo­
nents of the complex would be incompatible with survival to birth and
would not therefore be observed as post­natal human diseases. However,
mutations in components of TFIIH have been observed in the human dis­
ease xeroderma pigmentosum which results in skin defects and a higher
risk of cancer. Importantly, these mutations have been shown to result in

defective responses to transcriptional activators and repressors rather than
affecting the basal activity of TFIIH (Figure 12.8). This is presumably why
such mutations are compatible with survival, albeit with abnormal func­
tioning, which results in disease. Hence, specific human diseases can also
be caused by mutations in components of the basal transcriptional com­
plex (Figure 12.1c).

Factors involved in transcription by RNA polymerases
I and III

All the examples discussed above involve proteins which regulate transcrip­
tion by RNA polymerase II. However, specific diseases have also been iden­
tified where the abnormal protein is involved in transcription by the other
RNA polymerases. For example, in the case of RNA polymerase I, mutations
in the CSB protein which forms a complex with RNA polymerase I and other
proteins cause the disorder known as Cockayne’s syndrome, with abnor­
malities in the nervous system and skeleton. Similarly, the abnormal crani­
ofacial development characteristic of Treacher Collins syndrome has been
shown to result from mutations in the gene encoding a subunit common to
RNA polymerases I and III (see Chapter 4, Section 4.1 for discussion of the
subunit composition of different RNA polymerases).

12.2 THE EPIgENOME AND HUMAN DISEASE
As discussed in Chapters 2 and 3, changes in chromatin structure are an
essential prerequisite for activation and repression of transcription. It is not
surprising therefore that human diseases result when these processes are
disrupted (Figure 12.1d). The different processes involved in chromatin
structure which can be disrupted in human disease will be discussed in
turn.

(a) DNA methylation
A number of different mutations which affect DNA methylation have been
shown to be the cause of specific human diseases. For example, mutations
in the DNA methyltransferase enzyme Dnmt3b, which normally adds methyl
groups to C residues (see Chapter 3, Section 3.2), have been shown to cause
the human ICF syndrome (immunodeficiency, centromeric instability, facial
anomalies). Similarly, mutations in the MeCP2 factor which prevent it from
specifically recognizing methylated DNA result in the neurological disease
Rett syndrome (see Chapter 3, Section 3.2).
In addition, as well as resulting from alteration in methylation recogni­
tion proteins or DNA methylases, disease can also result from changes in
methylation patterns on the DNA. For example, in the human fragile X syn­
drome, a triplet sequence CGG which is present in 10–50 tandem copies in
the first exon of the FMR­1 gene is amplified so that over 230 tandem copies
are present in patients with this syndrome. This amplified sequence is then
heavily methylated on the C residues in the triplet repeat, resulting in tran­
scriptional silencing of the FMR-1 gene. The protein normally produced by
the FMR-1 gene acts as a regulator of the translation of other mRNAs and its
absence in turn produces the mental retardation and other symptoms char­
acteristic of the fragile X syndrome. This represents another mechanism by
which an expansion in a three­base sequence can cause disease, in addi­
tion to the sequestration of transcription factors which was discussed above
(Figure 12.9a).

(b) Histone-modifying enzymes
As well as involving DNA methylation, triplet repeat diseases can also
involve alterations in histone modifications which regulate chromatin struc­
ture (see Chapter 2, Section 2.3 and Chapter 3, Section 3.3) (Figure 12.9b).
For example ataxin, the gene which is mutated in the human triplet repeat
disease SCA7, encodes a histone acetyltransferase. The mutant ataxin pro­
tein found in SCA7 patients acts as a dominant negative inhibitor of the

involvement of chromatin structure in triplet

in the FMR-1 gene results in its methylation

ataxin protein encoded by a mutant ataxin

as a dominant negative protein, blocking
the histone acetyltransferase (HAT) activity

wild­type protein and prevents its opening the chromatin via its histone
acetyltransferase activity. Hence, triplet repeat diseases can involve differ­
ent effects on chromatin structure caused by altered DNA methylation or
altered histone modifications (Figure 12.9).
Altered histone modification is also observed in the human disease
X­linked mental retardation. Some patients with this disease have muta­
tions in the gene encoding the histone demethylase JARID1C. This demeth­
ylase normally functions to produce a closed chromatin structure by
demethylating histone H3 on the lysine at position 4 (see Chapter 2, Section
2.3 and Chapter 3, Section 3.3) and this activity is lost in the disease.
Interestingly, the JARID1C demethylase functions as a co­repressor for the
REST transcriptional repressor, which normally represses the expression of
neuronal genes in nonneuronal cells (see Chapter 10, Section 10.2). Hence,
inactivation of JARID1C interferes with the ability of REST to repress gene
expression (Figure 12.10a).
As well as facilitating the demethylation of histone H3 on lysine 4, REST
can also enhance methylation of H3 on lysine 9 which is associated with a
tightly packed chromatin structure incompatible with transcription (see
Chapter 3, Section 3). This effect of REST involves the mediator complex
(see Chapter 5, Section 5.2). Thus, X­linked mental retardation can also be
produced by mutations in the gene encoding the MED12 component of the
mediator complex. This MED12 mutation impairs REST function and the
methylation of histone H3 on lysine 9, resulting in inappropriate expression
of genes normally repressed by REST (Figure 12.10b).
Hence, X­linked mental retardation occurs in patients where the ability
of REST to repress gene expression is compromised by mutations in either
the mediator complex or in a histone demethylase which is involved in

The human disease X-linked mental

which disrupt the ability of the ResT factor
to organize a tightly packed chromatin

enzymes which alter histone modifications
such as methylation (HM) (a) or of the
mediator complex (M) which links ResT to
the histone-modifying enzymes (b).

432

Chapter 12: Gene Regulation and Human Disease

producing the closed chromatin structure by which REST represses its target
genes (Figure 12.10).
As well as involving alterations in histone modification, specific human
diseases can involve effects on the variant forms of the histones (see
Chapter 2, Section 2.3). This is observed in the human disease α­thalassemia/
mental retardation X­linked (ATRX). Patients with this form of thalassemia
not only lack globin gene expression as in other thalassemias (see for exam­
ple, Chapter 2, Section 2.5) but also have other symptoms such as mental
retardation. The normal form of the ATRX factor which is mutated in this
disease has been shown to enhance the deposition of the variant histone
3.3 in nucleosomes. As indicated in Chapter 2 (Section 2.3), histone 3.3 is
associated with active genes, so that its absence from nucleosomes due to
mutation of ATRX is likely to result in inappropriate repression of specific
genes, including α­globin itself and other genes involved in normal mental
development (Figure 12.11i).

(c) Chromatin-remodeling complexes
Apart from DNA methylation and histone modifications, other aspects of the
regulation of chromatin structure can also be affected in human diseases.
Indeed, a mutation in the SNF2 factor which is part of the chromatin­
remodeling SWI/SNF complex discussed in Chapter 3 (Section 3.5) can also
result in α­thalassemia combined with mental retardation. This indicates
that the activity of SNF2 is necessary for opening the chromatin structure of
both the α­globin genes and a number of other genes, so preventing their
transcription if it is absent (Figure 12.11ii).

ATRX (i) or of the sNF2 component of the
sWi/sNF complex (ii) prevents these effects
and the lack of expression of α-globin and
other genes produces α-thalassemia and
mental retardation (b).

POST-TRANSCRIPTIONAL PROCESSES AND HUMAN DISEASE

433

Similarly, the Williams syndrome transcription factor (WSTF), which is
mutated in the human disease Williams syndrome, is a component of the
WINAC chromatin­remodeling complex. This complex interacts with the
vitamin D receptor which is a member of the nuclear receptor family of
transcription factors (see Chapter 4, Section 4.3 and Chapter 5, Section 5.1).
Chromatin remodeling by the WINAC complex is essential for recruitment of
the vitamin D receptor to its target genes and this process is defective in
Williams syndrome, producing mental retardation and growth deficiency.

12.3 POST-TRANSCRIPTIONAL PROCESSES AND
HUMAN DISEASE
As well as affecting transcription factors and chromatin structure, muta­
tions can also affect gene regulation at specific post­transcriptional stages
(Figure 12.1e) and each of these stages will be discussed in turn (see
Chapters 6 and 7 for an account of these processes and their role in gene
regulation).

(a) RNA splicing
A number of mutations which affect the processes of RNA splicing or
alternative RNA splicing have been described and fall into two classes
(Figure 12.12). The first class involves a mutation in a sequence affect­
ing the splicing of a particular gene. Such mutations can result in a fail­
ure to properly splice its RNA (Figure 12.12a) or a failure to produce
one of the alternatively spliced mRNAs which are normally produced
(Figure 12.12c).

splicing events can be affected by a mutation

in an alternative splicing factor (As) (d).

434

Chapter 12: Gene Regulation and Human Disease

An example of a failure of splicing due to a mutation in the gene is
provided by the dystrophin gene. Thus, deletions of this gene producing a
lack of dystrophin protein result in severe cases of muscular dystrophy.
However, some mild cases in which dystrophin function is compromised
but not entirely lost result from a mutation in exon 31 of the dystrophin
gene. This results in abnormal splicing to produce an RNA lacking exon 31
(Figure 12.13a). In turn, this produces a dystrophin protein with reduced
activity resulting in a mild disease phenotype.
In contrast, a mutation in exon 10 of the gene encoding the tau protein
alters its alternative splicing. Normally alternative splicing results in exon
10 being included in 50% of tau mRNA molecules but being excluded from
the remaining 50% of tau mRNAs. In turn, this produces equal amounts of
two different forms of tau which are respectively encoded by mRNAs with or
without exon 10 (Figure 12.13b). The mutation in exon 10 results in a
greater proportion of the mRNA retaining exon 10, so resulting in an imbal­
ance between the different forms of tau and leading to the neuropathologi­
cal disease, frontotemporal dementia (Figure 12.13b).
In the second class of mutation affecting splicing, the mutation affects a
splicing factor and therefore affects a number of genes whose splicing requires
this factor either for the basic process of splicing itself (Figure 12.12b) or for
a particular pattern of alternative splicing (Figure 12.12d). Hence, the effect
of this class of mutation is not confined to a single gene.
An example of this type in which mutation of the protein affects the
splicing of a number of different RNAs is seen in the SMN1 gene. This gene
was originally defined on the basis of its mutation in the disease spinal mus­
cular atrophy (SMA). The SMN1 protein encoded by this gene has now been
shown to be essential for RNA splicing, being required for assembly of the
snRNP particles which catalyze RNA splicing (see Chapter 6, Section 6.3). Its
inactivation by mutation in SMA patients affects the splicing of a number of
RNAs and the alternative splicing pattern observed for other RNAs, so com­
bining the mechanisms illustrated in Figure 12.12b and Figure 12.12d.
Interestingly, alternative splicing is also affected in the muscle disease
type 1 myotonic dystrophy. As with Huntington’s disease and SCA7 (see
above), this disease involves the presence of abnormal repeats of a three­
base sequence, in this case CUG, in a specific gene. However, this run of
multiple CUG triplets is located in the 3′ untranslated region of the DM
kinase gene rather than in the protein­coding sequence, as is the case for
Huntingtin and SCA7.

POST-TRANSCRIPTIONAL PROCESSES AND HUMAN DISEASE

435

Moreover, this triplet repeat exerts its disease­causing effect at the RNA
level. Thus, the repeated sequence within the RNA promotes the formation
of RNA aggregates which sequester a specific alternative splicing factor,
MBNL1, and prevent it binding its normal RNA targets. As MBNL1 is required
for the transition from embryonic to adult patterns of alternative splicing in
a number of muscle­specific genes, this results in a failure to produce adult
forms of these proteins, so producing the disease.
This example is therefore similar to the Huntingtin/CBP case discussed
above, in that the repeat sequence sequesters a regulatory protein and pre­
vents it carrying out its normal functions. However, it differs in that it occurs
at the RNA level rather than at the protein level and involves a splicing fac­
tor rather than a transcription factor (Figure 12.14).
As well as affecting proteins involved in splicing, mutations in the RNAs
that catalyze the splicing process (see Chapter 6, Section 6.3) can also result
in human disease. For example, mutations in the gene encoding the U4atac
snRNA result in Taybi­Linder syndrome involving severe growth retarda­
tion, developmental defects, and death within 3 years of birth. As U4atac is
involved in a minor splicing pathway which is responsible for splicing a
minority of cellular RNAs (see Chapter 6, Section 6.3), this example indi­
cates that severe human disease can be caused by mutations affecting this
pathway as well as by mutation of an snRNA rather than a protein involved
in RNA splicing.
Overall the examples discussed above indicate that specific human
diseases can result either from mutations in RNAs and proteins involved
in RNA splicing which affect the splicing of their target RNAs or from
mutations in specific RNAs which affect their splicing pattern. Moreover,
in different cases both these effects can act at the level of the basic pro­
cess of splicing and at the level of alternative splicing (Figure 12.12).

(b) RNA translation
As well as affecting the splicing of mRNAs, mutations involved in specific
human diseases can also affect the processing of other cellular RNAs. For
example, mutations in the enzymes that process transfer RNA precursors to
produce the mature tRNA have been shown to cause the human neurolog­
ical disorder pontocerebellar hypoplasia.
Evidently, such defects in the production of mature tRNAs will affect the
translation of mRNAs by the ribosome in which tRNAs play a critical role (see
Chapter 6, Section 6.6). This is only one mechanism by which human dis­
eases can be caused by effects on the tRNAs involved in mRNA translation.
For example, mutations in the gene encoding glycyl tRNA synthase (which
links the glycine amino acid to its appropriate tRNA) cause one form of
Charcot­Marie­Tooth disease which affects the peripheral nervous system.

The expansion of a specific triplet sequence
in the Huntingtin gene in Huntington’s
disease (a) or in the dM protein kinase gene
in myotonic dystrophy (b) both produce
disease by binding regulatory proteins
and preventing them performing their
normal function. in the case of Huntingtin,
the repeated sequence is found in the
protein-coding sequence and produces a
mutant Huntingtin protein (H) with a run
of glutamine residues (Q) which binds
transcriptional regulators (T). However, in
the dM protein kinase case, the repeat
is in the 3′ untranslated region and is not
translated into protein. Rather, it is the
mRNA containing the repeat which binds
a regulator of alternative splicing (As).

Chapter 12: Gene Regulation and Human Disease

Effects on tRNA synthesis (Figure 12.15a) or tRNA binding of amino
acids (Figure 12.15b) can therefore produce specific human diseases.
Moreover, specific diseases can also be produced by mutations which target
other aspects of the translation apparatus such as ribosomal proteins
(Figure 12.15c) or translation initiation factors (Figure 12.15d) and the
kinases that regulate them (Figure 12.15e). For example, at least 50% of
patients with the erythroid cell disease Diamond­Blackfan syndrome carry
mutations in the genes encoding various ribosomal proteins. Similarly,
mutations in factors which regulate the activity of the translation initiation
factor eIF2 also produce specific human diseases. For example, the neuro­
logical disease, leukoencephalopathy with vanishing white matter, is pro­
duced by mutations in the eIF2B regulator of eIF2 (see Chapter 7, Section
7.6), while mutations in the PERK kinase which normally phosphorylates
eIF2 produce early onset diabetes (see Chapter 8, Section 8.6).
As discussed in Chapter 10 (Section 10.2) one of the functions of eIF2
phosphorylation is to control the balance between translation of the ATF4
mRNA to produce functional ATF4 protein and the translation of small
upstream open reading frames. In the ATF4 case, the translation of these
small open reading frames prevents ATF4 protein production because the
ribosome does not reinitiate at the translational start codon for ATF4
protein production. Such small open reading frames upstream of the
protein­coding region are also found in the gene encoding the Hairless
transcription factor (Figure 12.16). In this case however, the second of
these upstream open reading frames appears to encode a repressor which
represses the translation of the Hairless protein. Mutations of this upstream
open reading frame which affect the amino acid sequence of the repressor
protein result in overproduction of the Hairless protein (Figure 12.16). This
results in the disease Marie Unna hypotrichosis in which the individual
becomes totally bald.
Interestingly, altered mRNA translation can also be involved in the triplet
repeat expansion diseases which have been discussed in earlier sections of
this chapter. For example, as discussed in Section 12.2, the FMR­1 protein
encodes a regulator of mRNA translation and so the silencing of its gene by
abnormal DNA methylation affects the process of translation in many cases
of human fragile X disease.
In some cases of fragile X disease, however, the FMR-1 gene is expressed
but its corresponding mRNA is itself aberrantly translated. In this process,
known as RAN translation (repeat associated non­AUG), the ribosome
does not initiate translation at the normal AUG translation initiation codon
(see Chapter 6, Section 6.6 for discussion of the normal process of mRNA
translation). Rather it initiates translation within the CGG repeat sequence
to produce polyglycine or polyalanine depending on whether translation
takes place in the GGC or GCG reading frame (Figure 12.17a) (see
Chapter 6, Table 6.1 for the various codons and the amino acids they
encode). This process is likely to inhibit the translation of the FMR­1 mRNA
to produce the functional FMR­1 protein, as well as producing polymers of a
single amino acid which are likely to be toxic to the cell.
It should be noted that this process of RAN translation of triplet repeats
has been observed for other triplet repeat­containing genes, so that its
disease­causing effects are not confined to the FMR-1 gene. It is distinct
however, from the processes resulting in the production of a toxic form of
Huntingtin in Huntington’s disease (see Figure 12.17b), since in this case
the mutant Huntingtin mRNA is translated normally but produces an aber­
rant protein containing extra glutamine amino acids encoded by the
expanded CUG repeat.
FIgURE 12.16
An upstream open reading frame (uoRF2) in the Hairless mRNA encodes a
protein (u2HR) which normally represses translation of the mRNA to produce
the Hairless protein, so ensuring that the correct amount of Hairless protein
is present (a). specific mutations which inactivate u2HR (square) result in
overproduction of the Hairless protein leading to disease (b).

Although splicing and translation represent the post­transcriptional
stages of gene expression which have been most characterized in terms of
disease­causing mutations, other post­transcriptional stages also appear to
be affected in specific diseases. For example, a defect in RNA editing of the
glutamate receptor mRNA has been suggested to be involved in motor neu­
ron disease, while mutations in the mRNA export protein Gle1 produce
lethal congenital contracture syndrome­1, resulting in death of the fetus
before birth.

12.4 REgULATORY RNAs AND HUMAN DISEASE
As discussed in Chapter 11 (Section 11.6), abnormalities in different types of
regulatory RNAs have been shown to be of importance in human cancers,
paralleling their involvement in many aspects of normal gene regulation
(see Chapter 1, Section 1.5 for general discussion of the different classes of
regulatory RNAs). Similarly, different types of regulatory RNA are also
involved in other human diseases and they will be discussed in turn in this
section.

A variety of mechanisms underlie the involvement of
miRNAs in human diseases
Many human diseases involve the mutation of one specific gene, producing
an abnormal product and resulting in a disease which has a simple
Mendelian inheritance pattern. Such mutations frequently involve protein­
coding genes encoding, for example, a transcription factor (see Section
12.1). However, it is also possible for human disease to involve mutations in
genes encoding specific microRNAs (miRNAs).
The first such mutation to be characterized involved mutation in the gene
encoding miR­96, which causes a human disease involving progressive
hearing loss. Several other cases of human diseases caused by mutation in
various genes encoding miRNAs have now been characterized, indicating
that mutation in such genes can produce simple genetic diseases in the same
manner as mutations in protein­coding genes (Figure 12.18a).

(a) The presence of an expanded CGG
repeat in the mutant FMR-1 gene results in
aberrant translation of the mRNA in which
the ribosome initiates translation within
the repeat rather than at the normal AuG
codon. This prevents production of the
FMR-1 protein and instead produces toxic
polyglycine (GGC) or polyalanine (GCG)
proteins, depending on the reading frame in
which the repeat is translated. (b) in contrast,
the expanded CAG repeat in the mutant
Huntingtin gene is translated as part of the
Huntingtin protein to produce a mutant
protein containing additional glutamine
(Q) amino acids encoded by the extra
CAG codons.

Chapter 12: Gene Regulation and Human Disease
FIgURE 12.18
miRNAs can be involved in human disease in a variety of different ways
including mutation of the gene encoding the miRNA (miR) resulting in loss
of its normal effect (a), increased or decreased expression of the miRNA
producing an abnormally enhanced or reduced effect of the miRNA (b)
or alteration of its function produced by a disease-associated protein (X)
targeting the miRNA or the protein associated with it in the RNA-induced
silencing complex (RisC) (c).

In addition, abnormalities in miRNA expression or function can be
involved in more complex human diseases which are not caused by a single
genetic defect. This involvement of miRNAs has been extensively investi­
gated in human neurodegenerative diseases, which are likely to involve the
interaction of multiple genetic and environmental factors. The involvement
of miRNAs in these more complex diseases appears to involve two different
mechanisms. Thus, in some cases the disease process can result in the
altered expression of a specific miRNA, thereby altering its effect on its tar­
get mRNAs (Figure 12.18b).
An example of this is observed in the hippocampus region of the brain
in human patients with Alzheimer’s disease, where expression of the
miRNA, miR­34c is up­regulated. Evidently, the enhanced expressed miR­34c
will result in post­transcriptional down­regulation in the expression of its
target mRNAs such as that encoding the SIRT1 protein (see Chapter 7,
Section 7.7 for discussion of the mechanisms of miRNA­mediated post­
transcriptional repression). In turn, enhanced expression of miR­34c and
down­regulation of SIRT1 has been shown to result in memory impair­
ment in mice, so relating these effects to the observed symptoms of human
Alzheimer’s disease.
As well as altered expression, specific neurodegenerative diseases can
also involve effects on the function of miRNAs (Figure 12.18c). For example,
the mutant form of the LRRK2 protein which is found in some cases of human
Parkinson’s disease has been shown to associate with the human Argonaute­2
(Ago­2) protein. As discussed in Chapter 7 (Section 7.7), Argonaute proteins
are part of the RNA­induced silencing complex (RISC) within which the
miRNA binds to its target mRNA and represses gene expression. In this case,
the association of LRRK2 with Ago­2 reduces the ability of the microRNAs,
Let­7 and miR­184, to inhibit mRNA translation, resulting in enhanced
expression of the proteins encoded by these mRNAs (Figure 12.19).

Long noncoding RNAs are involved in human disease at both the
transcriptional and post-transcriptional levels
As discussed in Chapter 1 (Section 1.5), long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs)
can affect gene expression either at the level of transcription (via alterations
in chromatin structure or via directly affecting the process of transcription
itself) or post­transcriptionally. Alterations at both these levels caused by
effects on lncRNAs are observed in different human diseases.
Thus, in contrast to the repeat expansion diseases discussed above
(see Sections 12.1–12.3), the human muscle disease facioscapulohumeral
muscular dystrophy (FSHD) involves a reduction in the number of DNA

copies of a repeated sequence known as D4Z4 within the FSHD gene
locus. This has been shown to result in the enhanced production of a novel
lncRNA, known as DBE­T, from the FSHD gene locus. This results in DBE­T
recruiting trithorax proteins to the FSHD locus and blocks the normal
recruitment of the polycomb proteins to this region. As discussed in
Chapter 4 (Section 4.4), polycomb proteins produce a more tightly packed
chromatin structure while trithorax proteins produce a more open struc­
ture. Hence, the effect of the DBE­T lncRNA will be to produce a more
open chromatin structure, resulting in abnormally enhanced transcription
of the FSHD locus (Figure 12.20).
In contrast, an lncRNA involved in the human neurological disorder,
Prader­Willi syndrome, acts at the post­transcriptional level. Thus, this
RNA is encoded by the SNORD116 gene locus and normally functions by
binding the Fox2 alternative RNA splicing factor. This controls the level of
free Fox2 so ensuring it is present in the appropriate amounts to correctly
regulate alternative splicing events. Prader­Willi syndrome is caused by a
deletion which removes the SNORD116 locus and the adjacent DNA region.
This results in abnormally high levels of free Fox2, so producing changes
in alternative splicing events and abnormal development (Figure 12.21).
When taken together with the miRNA examples discussed above, these
examples of the involvement of lncRNAs in human disease indicate the
important role in human diseases of alterations in regulatory RNAs.

INFECTIOUS DISEASES AND CELLULAR gENE
EXPRESSION

In this chapter, we have discussed the involvement of mutations in gene
regulatory proteins and DNA sequences in the causation of specific inher­
ited human diseases. In addition, however, gene regulatory processes are
also involved in human diseases caused by infection with agents such as
viruses and bacteria.
In particular, viruses are intracellular parasites which utilize the cellular
machinery to replicate their nucleic acid and synthesize their proteins. In
many cases this results in the cells becoming a bag of viral particles (con­
taining viral nucleic acid packaged in viral proteins), which eventually
bursts open to release the viral particles. To convert the cell into a virus­
producing factory, these viruses frequently encode proteins which inhibit

cellular gene expression so as to enhance the efficiency of viral gene expres­
sion. For example, herpes simplex virus produces a protein, known as vhs
(virion host shut off protein), which degrades cellular mRNAs, so ensuring
that cellular ribosomes are available to translate viral mRNAs.
Similarly, several groups of viruses produce a decapping enzyme, which
removes the 5′ cap from cellular mRNAs (see Chapter 6, Section 6.1), thereby
preventing their translation. This mechanism effectively prevents transla­
tion of cellular mRNAs but obviously raises the question of how viral mRNAs
are recognized by the 40S ribosomal subunit, which normally recognizes
the cap and the translation factors bound to it (Figure 12.22a). In the case
of the Picornaviruses, this is achieved by the viral RNA having internal ribo­
some entry sites (IRES) so allowing the 40S ribosomal subunit to bind to the
RNA in a cap­independent manner (Figure 12.22b) (see Chapter 7, Section
7.6 for further discussion of IRES sequences).
In contrast, another group of viruses, the Hantaviruses, encode a protein
(known as N) which binds to the 5′ end of the RNA and mimics the cellular
eIF4F complex (containing the eIF4E cap­binding protein) (see Chapter 6,
Section 6.6). This allows the 40S ribosomal subunit to recognize the
Hantavirus RNA so allowing its translation (Figure 12.22c).
As well as inhibiting cellular gene expression, viruses must also attempt
to overcome the cellular antiviral responses which occur following viral
infection. A complex interplay therefore exists between cellular defense
mechanisms and the attempts of viruses to overcome these, and such inter­
play frequently involves gene regulatory processes.
This interplay is well illustrated by the cellular interferon system and its
inhibition by various viruses. Following infection with a number of different
viruses, the cellular genes encoding the antiviral proteins interferon α and
interferon β are induced. In turn, these proteins bind to cellular receptors
and induce the phosphorylation of the STAT family transcription factors,
STAT1 and STAT2 (Figure 12.23) (see Chapter 8, Section 8.2 for

so maintaining a closed chromatin structure

their transcription (b).

description of these factors and their activation by phosphorylation). The
activated STAT1 and STAT2 then bind to each other to form a STAT1/STAT2
heterodimer. They then enter the nucleus where they interact with another
protein, IRF9, and then bind to the DNA of their target genes, activating their
expression (Figure 12.23). These target genes encode a variety of antiviral
proteins and miRNAs, which act to inhibit viral infection.
Many viruses interfere with this activation of antiviral transcriptional reg­
ulatory proteins by targeting one or more of the components of the pathway.
For example, specific viruses interfere with the receptor­associated Jak
kinases, which phosphorylate the STAT transcription factors (Figure 12.23a),
while others induce the degradation of STATs (Figure 12.23b) or dephos­
phorylate them (Figure 12.23c). Other viruses block the movement of acti­
vated STATs to the nucleus (Figure 12.23d) or target the IRF9 transcription
factor (Figure 12.23e).
In addition to blocking transcription factor activation directly by these
mechanisms, viruses can also affect the changes in chromatin structure
required for the activation of antiviral cellular genes following infection. It
has been shown that the NSI protein of the H3N2 influenza virus contains an
amino acid sequence that allows it to be methylated by the SET1 histone
methyltransferase. This therefore competes for the normal substrate of SET,
which is histone H3, and so blocks histone H3 methylation on lysine 4. As
discussed in Chapter 3 (Section 3.3) this modification of histone H3 is impor­
tant for an open chromatin structure. Hence, inhibiting this methylation will
prevent the opening in the chromatin structure of antiviral genes required
for their induction by virus infection and maintain them in a closed chroma­
tin structure incompatible with transcription (Figure 12.24).
Interestingly, as well as regulating the synthesis or activity of cellular
antiviral proteins, viruses can also target miRNAs. For example, infection
with Kaposi’s sarcoma­associated herpes virus (KSHV) results in the
enhanced expression of miR­132. In turn, miR­132 post­transcriptionally
inhibits the expression of the p300 co­activator (see Chapter 5, Section 5.2
for discussion of p300 and other co­activators of transcription). As p300 is
required as a co­activator for the transcription of interferon­inducible anti­
viral genes, this will have the effect of blocking the transcription of these
genes (Figure 12.25).
As well as blocking the pathways producing transcriptional activation
of specific genes by interferon α and β, viruses can also target the tran­
scription of the genes encoding the α and β interferons. For example, the
NFκB transcription factor plays a key role in the activation of the gene
encoding β­interferon following viral infection (see Chapter 4, Section 4.4).
Specific viruses can inhibit this effect by inhibiting either NFκB itself or the
IκB kinases (which normally phosphorylate the inhibitory IκB protein, and

thereby activate NFκB) (see Chapter 8, Section 8.2 for discussion of the
NFκB/IκB system).
These examples illustrate therefore the involvement of gene regulatory
processes in infectious diseases. Moreover, as in the inherited diseases dis­
cussed in Sections 12.1–12.4, these effects can involve both transcriptional
and post­transcriptional processes.

12.6

gENE REgULATION AND THERAPY OF HUMAN
DISEASE

As discussed in Chapter 11 and this chapter, respectively, the role of aberrant
gene regulation in cancer and many other diseases is now increasingly well
understood. As our knowledge of this area develops it is becoming clear that
such increased understanding could lead to improved therapy for such dis­
eases based on the manipulation of gene expression. These possibilities are
discussed in this section both for cancer and for the other human diseases.

Therapy could be achieved by altering the expression
of transcription factors
In some cases, therapy might involve artificially increasing the expression of a
regulatory protein. For example, as described in Chapter 8 (Section 8.2), acti­
vation of the NFκB transcription factor plays a key role in the immune response.
Hence, blocking its activity would be of value in treating human diseases
involving damaging inflammation. This could potentially be achieved by
enhancing the levels of the inhibitory IκB protein, either by identifying drugs
which can switch on the patient’s own IκB gene or by using a gene therapy
procedure to deliver exogenous copies of the IκB gene (Figure 12.26a).
Alternatively, a similar therapeutic benefit could be achieved by inhibit­
ing the synthesis of NFκB itself (Figure 12.26b). One potential method of
doing this would be to artificially synthesize small inhibitory RNAs directed
against NFκB (see below for further discussion of this potential means of
targeting gene regulatory proteins).
Although these potential therapeutic approaches are of interest, they are
not specific to gene regulatory proteins but could be used for any protein
where increased or decreased expression was desired. Moreover, currently
they suffer from the limitation that methods to deliver an exogenous gene
or small inhibitory RNAs safely and efficiently to human patients are still
being developed. Similarly, considerable effort will be required to identify
drugs which can alter the expression of the endogenous gene encoding, for
example, a transcription factor in a safe, specific, and effective manner.

Therapy could be achieved by altering the activity

Interestingly however, a number of therapeutic drugs which are currently
taken by many patients act by regulating the activity of transcription fac­
tors. In many cases, these drugs were introduced on the basis of their effi­
cacy in a particular situation and were only shown to act via a transcription
factor many years later. For example, salicylate (aspirin), one of the most
commonly used drugs, was introduced many years ago. Much more
recently, it was shown that it can inhibit IκB phosphorylation, thereby pro­
moting the association of IκB with NFκB and having an anti­inflammatory
effect (Figure 12.26c).

GENE REGULATION AND THERAPY OF HUMAN DISEASE
This example suggests that targeting the phosphorylation of transcrip­
tion factors, which is often essential for their activation (see Chapter 8,
Section 8.2) may have therapeutic potential. Indeed, when the mechanism
of action of the commonly used anti­inflammatory drugs cyclosporin and
FK506 (tacrolimus) was characterized, they were found to block the dephos­
phorylation of the NFAT transcription factor which is required for an effec­
tive immune response (Figure 12.27a).
As well as targeting phosphorylation of transcription factors, therapies of
this type could also target proteins which regulate other stages of gene
expression and which are regulated by phosphorylation. An obvious poten­
tial example of this is the PI­3 kinase/Akt/TOR kinase cascade, which reg­
ulates the process of mRNA translation and which is up­regulated in various
cancers (see Chapter 8, Section 8.6 and Chapter 11, Section 11.5). Indeed,
various chemical inhibitors of each of the kinases in this pathway have been
developed and are being tested both alone and in combination for their
therapeutic potential in cancer.
Clearly therapies could also target post­translational modifications other
than phosphorylation which affect transcription factor activity (see Chapter
8, Section 8.3). For example, the HIF­1 factor is an attractive therapeutic
target since its inhibition could prevent the growth of blood vessels supply­
ing tumors and therefore have a beneficial effect in cancer (see Chapter 11,
Section 11.3). Conversely, in patients suffering from cardiovascular disease
it would be beneficial to promote blood vessel formation by stimulating
HIF­1 activity. As described in Chapter 8 (Section 8.3), HIF­1 activity is reg­
ulated by hydroxylation of proline residues within the protein by a proline
hydroxylase enzyme. Drugs have now been developed which target this
enzyme and which could potentially be used therapeutically to enhance or
reduce its activity (Figure 12.27b).
Similarly, the degradation of p53 induced by MDM2 (see Chapter 11,
Section 11.3) could be reduced by drugs which inhibit MDM2­mediated
ubiquitination of p53. This would stabilize p53 and allow it to exert its
anti­oncogenic effect, even in tumors where MDM2 is overexpressed
(Figure 12.27c).
As well as targeting post­translational modification, it is also possible to
target protein–protein interactions which can also play a role in transcrip­
tion factor activation (see Chapter 8). It is now relatively easy to map the
region of a specific protein which interacts with another protein and to con­
firm this by structural studies. Once this has been achieved, small peptides
can be prepared which mimic the binding region. These therefore compete
for binding and can be used to disrupt the protein–protein interaction.
For example, a small peptide has been used to disrupt the protein–
protein interactions in the IκB kinase (IKK), which is a multiprotein complex
required for the phosphorylation of IκB. This peptide therefore blocked IκB
phosphorylation (which is required for NFκB activation) and produced an
anti­inflammatory effect in vivo (Figure 12.26d).
Hence, a variety of potential therapeutic methods for inhibiting NFκB
exist, with salicylate treatment being used clinically (Figure 12.26). This
potential modulation of NFκB is of particular importance in view of its key
role in inflammation and more recent indications that it is involved in cer­
tain types of cancer.
Although the identification of peptides which can disrupt protein–protein
interactions is of value, their potential therapeutic application is limited by
the ability to deliver them efficiently to the target cells in the patient’s body.
Ideally, it would be preferable to develop small diffusible molecules which
would be simple to deliver and would disrupt specific protein–protein inter­
actions. This has been achieved in the case of the interaction between the
anti­oncogene p53 and MDM2 (see above). Thus, structural studies indi­
cated that part of the p53 protein inserts itself into a deep pocket in the
MDM2 molecule. A chemical compound designed to fill this pocket was able
to block p53/MDM2 binding and thereby activated p53, leading to reduced
tumor growth both in culture and in the intact animal (Figure 12.28 and
Figure 12.29).

Chapter 12: Gene Regulation and Human Disease

This type of drug which targets protein–protein interaction is therefore
likely to be of value clinically, paralleling the use of drugs such as salicylate
or cyclosporin/FK506 which target phosphorylation. It should be noted that
this approach and that of targeting p53 ubiquitination (see above) would be
of value only in tumors with intact p53. In tumors which have a mutant p53
that acts as an oncogene (see Chapter 11, Section 11.3), stabilizing the
mutant p53 by blocking MDM2 would be counterproductive.
As well as transcription factor activity being regulated by phosphoryla­
tion or protein–protein interaction, it can also be regulated by ligand bind­
ing (see Chapter 8, Section 8.1). This is seen particularly in the members of
the nuclear receptor family of transcription factors which are activated by
their appropriate ligand. This effect has been exploited therapeutically in
different situations to either stimulate a receptor or inhibit it. For example,
in breast cancers which are dependent on estrogen for their growth, therapy
can involve the drug tamoxifen. This competes with estrogen for binding to
the estrogen receptor but does not induce gene activation by the receptor
following binding.
Conversely, as discussed in Section 12.1, the PPARγ member of the
nuclear receptor family is mutated in a few patients with diabetes, indicat­
ing its normal role in preventing the disease. In the vast majority of patients
who have a normal PPARγ receptor and whose disease is due to other
causes, the disease could be treated by stimulating the activity of the recep­
tor. This would be achieved by using synthetic drugs, known as thiazolidin­
ediones, which bind to the receptor and stimulate its activity. Although the
initially available drugs of this kind also caused side effects such as weight
gain, osteoporosis, and heart failure, a new generation of PPARγ­activating
drugs has now been developed which have the potential to achieve a more
specific therapeutic effect.
Hence, in different therapeutic applications, treatment can be carried
out by either inhibiting the activity of a member of the nuclear receptor
family of transcription factors (Figure 12.30a) or artificially stimulating it
(Figure 12.30b).
A similar therapeutic approach has also been used in cases of promye­
locytic leukemia involving the oncogenic fusion protein linking the PML
protein with the retinoic acid receptor α (RARα) protein, which is a member
of the nuclear receptor family. As discussed in Chapter 11 (Section 11.2),
this fusion protein acts as a repressor of transcription, unlike the parental
RARα protein, which stimulates transcription following activation by reti­
noic acid.
One means of treating this form of leukemia therefore involves the
administration of retinoic acid to stimulate the gene activation properties
of the retinoic acid receptor portion of the fusion protein and overcome
the transcriptional inhibition normally produced by the fusion protein
(Figure 12.31a).

Therapy could be achieved by targeting proteins
which alter chromatin structure
In view of the involvement of epigenetic/chromatin changes in cancer
(Chapter 11, Section 11.4) and other human diseases (Section 12.2) there is
obvious potential in developing drugs which target these changes for ther­
apeutic benefit. Considerable progress has been made in the targeting of
several different epigenetic changes and these will be discussed in turn.

(a) Histone acetylation
Although treatment of promyelocytic leukemia with retinoic acid (see
above) is effective in some cases, especially when combined with chemo­
therapy, it does not produce a long­term cure in many cases. This has led to
the idea of an alternative therapy based on the finding that the RAR/PML
fusion protein represses gene expression by recruiting histone deacetylases
which produce an inactive chromatin structure (see Chapter 11, Section
11.2). Histone deacetylase inhibitors have thus been developed and may

Alternative approaches to overcoming the transcription

ultimately have a clinical role in leukemia caused by the RAR/PML fusion
protein, acting by blocking the gene repression caused by the fusion protein
(Figure 12.31b).
As noted in Chapter 11 (Section 11.2), histone deacetylation is involved
in gene repression induced by other oncogenic fusion proteins such as
AML­ETO. This approach may therefore be applicable in a number of differ­
ent human leukemias and in other cancers. Indeed, several histone
deacetylase inhibitors such as vorinostat have proved successful in clinical
trials and have been approved for marketing and clinical use in human can­
cer patients.
As well as directly targeting the enzymes involved in histone acetyla­
tion/deacetylation, it is also possible to target the proteins which are
recruited by histone acetylation/deacetylation. Thus, as described in
Chapter 3 (Section 3.3) bromodomain­containing proteins interact pref­
erentially with acetylated histones leading to a more open chromatin
structure. Small molecule drugs have been developed which block the
interaction of the bromodomain­containing protein with the acetylated
histones, thereby blocking the change in chromatin structure.
One such drug has been developed for human midline carcinoma in
which a fusion protein is produced linking the bromodomain protein BRD4
with another protein, NUT (see Chapter 11, Section 11.2 for discussion of
oncogenic fusion proteins). The BRD4–NUT fusion protein produces abnor­
mally enhanced histone acetylation and opening in the chromatin of genes
associated with growth stimulation. Hence, small molecules blocking the
interaction of BRD4–NUT with acetylated histones could be used therapeu­
tically in midline carcinomas (Figure 12.32a).
Similarly, another such drug has been developed to block the interaction
of the normal BRD4 protein with acetylated histones, so preventing the
excessive and damaging activation of pro­inflammatory genes in septic
shock (Figure 12.32b). This example indicates that targeting histone
acetylation is likely to be of applicability in human diseases other than can­
cer. For example, it may be possible to treat the neurodegenerative disease
SCA7 by stimulating the histone acetyltransferase activity of the wild­type
ataxin protein, so as to overcome the inhibitory effect of the mutant ataxin
protein which causes this disease (see Section 12.2 and Figure 12.9).

(b) Histone methylation
As discussed in Chapter 11 (Section 11.4) and Section 12.2 of this chapter,
altered histone methylation plays a key role in cancer and other human dis­
eases. For example, the oncogenic MLL­containing fusion proteins can recruit
the DOT1L methyltransferase enzyme which can methylate histone H3 on
lysine 79. This produces a more open chromatin structure, allowing the tran­
scription of genes encoding growth stimulatory proteins, and is required for
the oncogenic action of MLL­containing fusion proteins (Figure 12.33a). A
number of inhibitors have now been developed which specifically target the
DOT1L enzyme without affecting other histone methyltransferases and sev­
eral of these are being used in clinical trials in human patients with MLL.
Similarly, the enhanced expression of the EZH2 polycomb protein in
several cancers produces enhanced methylation of histone H3 on lysine 27
at specific target genes (see Chapter 11, Section 11.4). Unlike methylation of
lysine 79 of histone H3, this produces a more closed chromatin structure,
inhibiting the transcription of genes encoding growth­inhibiting proteins

(Figure 12.33b). As in the case of MLL­containing fusion proteins, drugs
have been developed which target the methyltransferase activity of
EZH2. Hence, in different cancers therapy might be achieved by inhibiting
histone methyltransferases which either produce inappropriate activation of
growth­stimulating genes or inappropriate inhibition of growth­inhibiting
genes (Figure 12.33).
As well as being of therapeutic use in cancer, drugs which target histone
methylation may also be of use in other human diseases. For example, as
discussed in Section 12.1, one effect of the mutant Huntingtin protein which
is present in Huntington’s chorea is to interfere with the transcriptional
induction of a number of different genes. It has recently been shown that
stimulating the methylation of histone H3 on lysine 4 can open the chroma­
tin structure of neuronal genes which are down­regulated in Huntington’s
disease and so enhance their expression. Although this has so far only been
achieved in cultured neuronal cells, it does indicate the potential of epige­
netic therapies which stimulate the expression of genes that have been
down­regulated by the disease process (Figure 12.34a).
Rather than targeting the downstream targets of an abnormal gene
product, it is also possible to consider modulating histone methylation to

induce a gene whose protein product can substitute for the abnormal gene
product (Figure 12.34b). One approach to diseases such as β­thalassemia,
in which functional β­globin is not produced, would be to induce expression
in adults of the γ­globin gene. Thus γ­globin substitutes for β­globin in the
embryo but its expression is switched off in the adult (see Chapter 3, Section
3.5 for discussion of the developmental expression of the β­globin gene
cluster). Indeed, it has been shown that inhibition of lysine­specific demeth­
ylase 1 in cultured erythroid cells or in mice can induce γ­globin gene
expression, indicating the feasibility of this approach.

(c) DNA methylation
As noted in Chapter 3 (Section 3.1) and Chapter 10 (Section 10.1), the artifi­
cial manipulation of DNA methylation levels using 5­azacytidine can have
profound effects on gene expression and cellular differentiation. When
taken together with the alterations in DNA methylation patterns observed in
cancer (Chapter 11, Section 11.4) and other human diseases (Section 12.2),
this makes the manipulation of DNA methylation a potential therapeutic
target in human disease.
Indeed, azacytidine itself was the first epigenetic agent licensed to be
marketed for therapeutic use in humans. It has proved successful in improv­
ing the quality of life and survival times in patients with myelodysplastic
syndromes who develop leukemia and is the first therapy shown to improve
survival in these patients. This success is likely to stimulate further efforts
targeting DNA methyltransferase enzymes to appropriately manipulate DNA
methylation in human diseases.
When taken together with the therapies aimed at manipulating his­
tone modifications, these findings indicate the therapeutic potential of
drugs which manipulate epigenetic modifications. As we have dis­
cussed, such drugs could target the modification itself (e.g. azacytidine)
(Figure 12.35a), the enzymes which produce the modification (e.g. his­
tone acetyltransferases or histone methyltransferases) (Figure 12.35b),
the enzymes which remove it (e.g. histone deacetylases or histone demeth­
ylases) (Figure 12.35c) or the proteins which interact with the modification
(e.g. the interaction of acetylated histones and bromodomain­containing
proteins) (Figure 12.35d). Indeed, as noted above drugs targeting DNA
methylation itself or histone deacetylase enzymes are already on the mar­
ket and in use in human patients, while other epigenetic therapies are in
human clinical trials and many more are undergoing pre­clinical testing in
animals.

Therapy could be achieved using designer zinc fingers
to alter gene transcription
Although epigenetic therapies offer considerable promise, they suffer from
the difficulty in making their effect specific to the target gene(s) whose
expression needs to be manipulated. Thus, for example, a drug directed
against a particular histone deacetylase may also affect other histone
deacetylases whose targets are not involved in the disease process.
Moreover, even if a drug can be made specific to one enzyme, that enzyme
may have a multitude of targets in addition to those involved in the disease,
leading to undesirable side effects. Hence, there are considerable advan­
tages in developing therapeutic methods which very specifically target the
gene primarily responsible for the disease.
One such therapeutic approach exists, which takes advantage of a
specific property of transcription factors to manipulate the expression of a
specific gene in the genome. As described in Chapter 5 (Section 5.1), the
two­cysteine–two­histidine zinc finger has an α­helical region which con­
tacts the DNA. It has been shown that the nature of the amino acids at the
N­terminus of this α­helix determines the exact DNA sequence to which the
zinc finger binds. Moreover, it is now possible to predict the exact DNA
sequence which will be bound by a finger with particular amino acids at the
N­terminus of the α­helix.
On the basis of this, zinc fingers can be designed which will bind to a
specific target sequence that is present in a particular gene of interest. If
such a designer zinc finger is introduced into cells, it will bind specifically
to the target gene and not to all the other genes in the cell that do not con­
tain its target sequence.
If this designer zinc finger is linked to the inhibitory domain of a tran­
scription factor (see Chapter 5, Section 5.3) or to a nuclease enzyme
which destroys the gene, it will deliver the linked domain to the target
gene and specifically inhibit it (Figure 12.36a). This method therefore
offers an exciting means of specifically switching off a target gene. It has
been used, for example, in clinical trials in human patients infected with
human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) to inactivate the cellular gene
encoding the CCR5 protein which normally acts as a receptor allowing
HIV to enter cells.
Evidently, as well as using this approach to inhibit the expression of a
single gene it is also possible to specifically activate an individual gene by
linking the designer finger to the activation domain of a transcription factor
(see Chapter 5, Section 5.2) (Figure 12.36b). This approach has been used
to activate the gene encoding the vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF)
in the intact animal in vivo. The enhanced levels of VEGF produced were
functional and were able to produce increased blood vessel growth, indicat­
ing that this effect could be of therapeutic value in diseases where patients
suffer from poor blood supply (Figure 12.37).

GENE REGULATION AND THERAPY OF HUMAN DISEASE

449

Although there have been some doubts about whether zinc finger­
containing contacts may nonspecifically target genes other than the desired
target gene, this approach has considerable therapeutic potential, since unlike
the other methods we have discussed it can target any gene regardless of its
normal method of regulation. Indeed, this type of approach can be extended
by using any DNA­binding domain where, as with the zinc finger, the relation­
ship of the precise amino acids in the DNA­binding domain to the DNA
sequence that is bound has been worked out. For example, a similar approach
to the zinc finger­based one is being developed using transcription activator­
like effectors (TALEs), which although derived from plants can be engineered
to target specific DNA sequences when introduced into animal cells.

Therapy could be achieved by modulating RNA splicing
So far in this section, we have focused on potential therapeutic methods
which are designed to modulate transcription either directly or via altering
chromatin structure. As noted above, however, it is also possible to manip­
ulate kinase pathways such as the PI­3 kinase/Akt/TOR cascade to achieve
potentially therapeutic effects on mRNA translation.
It is also potentially possible to achieve a therapeutic effect at the
post­transcriptional level by modulating RNA splicing. In different cases this
could be achieved either by promoting the use of a particular splice site or
by inhibiting the use of a particular site.
An example of the potential use of splicing inhibition is provided by the
dystrophin gene whose mutation causes muscular dystrophy (see Section
12.3). In one type of this disease, exon 49 of the dystrophin gene is deleted
together with its flanking introns, so fusing exons 48 and 50. This changes
the reading frame of the resulting mRNA so that translation into protein
ceases at an in frame stop codon in exon 51 (Figure 12.38).

Region of the dystrophin gene containing exons 49, 50, 51, and
52. Normally, these exons are spliced together to produce a
functional mRNA (a). in some cases of muscular dystrophy, exon
49 is deleted resulting in exons 48 and 50 being fused together.
This changes the reading frame of the resulting mRNA, producing
a premature translational stop codon (circle) in exon 51 and
resulting in a nonfunctional truncated protein (b). A potential
therapeutic approach involves using an antisense oligonucleotide
to block the inclusion of exon 51 in the mRNA. This removes the
premature stop codon and allows all the exons downstream
of exon 51 to be translated, so producing a partially functional
protein (c).

450

Chapter 12: Gene Regulation and Human Disease

One potential therapy for this form of the disease would be to inhibit the
inclusion of exon 51 in the mRNA. Since the resulting mRNA would lack
exon 51, as well as the deleted exon, it would not contain the premature
stop codon. Given that the open reading frame of exon 52 would then be in
frame with the open reading frame of the fused exons 48 and 50, the mRNA
would continue to be translated beyond the exon 51 region, so producing a
less severely damaged protein (Figure 12.38).
To inhibit the splicing of exon 51, it is possible to use a short antisense
oligonucleotide which is complementary to the 3′ splice site of exon 51 and
which inhibits the inclusion of exon 51 in the mRNA (Figure 12.38). This
approach has proved effective in animal models of the disease and clinical
trials in human patients with this form of muscular dystrophy have shown
improved muscle function.
It is also potentially possible to achieve a therapeutic effect by promoting
the inclusion of a particular exon in the mRNA. An example of this is the
disease spinal muscular atrophy (SMA) which, as described in Section 12.3,
is caused by the deletion of the SMN1 gene.
All human individuals, including SMA patients, have a second closely
related gene, known as SMN2. The protein encoded by this gene could
potentially substitute for the lack of SMN1 in SMA patients. However, the
SMN2 protein is produced at low levels which are insufficient to do this. This
is because in all human individuals (including SMA patients), compared
with SMN1, the SMN2 gene has a C to T base change in an exon­splicing
enhancer (ESE) located in exon 7 (Figure 12.39).
As discussed in Chapter 6 (Section 6.3) ESEs promote the inclusion of
the exon in the final mRNA by stimulating the recruitment of SR splicing
factors to the RNA. The base change in the exon 7 ESE in SMN2 compared
with SMN1 weakens the ESE. This results in exon skipping, with exon 7
frequently being omitted from the SMN2 mRNA (Figure 12.39a). In turn,
this results in a nonfunctional SMN2 protein lacking the portion of the pro­
tein encoded by exon 7.
One potential therapy which is being developed for SMA would involve
preparing an oligonucleotide complementary to the exon 7 ESE in SMN2
and linking it to an SR protein. By recruiting the SR protein to the RNA, this
would facilitate the correct splicing of the SMN2 mRNA so as to include
exon 7 (Figure 12.39b). In turn, this will result in an increased amount of
functional SMN2 protein able to substitute for SMN1.
The examples discussed so far involve targeting the splicing of an indi­
vidual RNA using specific oligonucleotides. However, as noted in Section
12.3, some human diseases involve widespread abnormalities in RNA
splicing. For example, the repeated sequences present in the abnormal
DM kinase mRNA (found in type 1 myotonic dystrophy) form aggregates
which sequester the MBNL1 splicing factor and prevent it carrying out its
normal role in the alternative splicing of many RNAs. Short oligonucleo­
tides which are complementary to the repeated sequence in the abnormal
DM kinase mRNA have been shown to bind to it and disrupt the aggre­
gates, thereby releasing MBNL1 and restoring appropriate alternative
splicing (Figure 12.40).

Compared to the SMN1 gene, the SMN2

in an exon-splicing enhancer (ese: pink) in
exon 7. This results in exon 7 frequently
being skipped and excluded from the RNA
(a). in patients with spinal muscular atrophy
(sMA) the SMN1 gene is deleted. However,
an oligonucleotide complementary to the
ese could be used to artificially recruit an
sR splicing protein to the ese, so promoting
inclusion of exon 7 in the sMN2 mRNA. This
would enhance the level of functional sMN2
and have a therapeutic effect by allowing it
to substitute for sMN1 (b).

GENE REGULATION AND THERAPY OF HUMAN DISEASE

451

Hence, the modulation of splicing using short oligonucleotides repre­
sents a promising therapeutic approach in several different human dis­
eases. This approach is likely to be of increasing value in the future as
improved methods are developed which can effectively deliver such oligo­
nucleotides to the appropriate cells in the patient.

Therapy could be achieved by targeting regulatory RNAs
As with proteins and the genes which encode them, the involvement of reg­
ulatory RNAs in cancer (see Chapter 11, Section 11.6) and other human
diseases (Section 12.4) indicates that they are targets for therapeutic manip­
ulation. In different diseases this could involve either enhancing or reducing
the effect of a regulatory RNA depending on its role in the disease process.
Clearly, the endogenous genes encoding miRNAs could be targeted, for
example, by epigenetic methods (Figure 12.41a) or zinc finger technol­
ogy (Figure 12.41b) in the same way as for protein­coding genes.
Similarly, gene therapy technology could be used to overexpress an miRNA
by introducing into the cell exogenous copies of the gene encoding it
(Figure 12.41c).
However, in addition to these general methods, methods specific to
targeting miRNAs rather than protein­coding genes have been devel­
oped. Thus, for example, small molecule drugs have been developed
which enhance the processing of miRNAs from their precursor RNAs
(Figure 12.41d) (see Chapter 1, Section 1.5). This may prove an effec­
tive therapy in diseases where a number of different miRNAs show
reduced expression, so that generally boosting miRNA production could
be of therapeutic benefit.
In many other diseases, however, it will be necessary to specifically
inhibit one or a small number of miRNAs involved in the disease process.
This has been achieved in a number of cases in animal models of human
disease using short DNA or RNA antisense oligonucleotides complementary
to the miRNA. These sequences act by binding to the miRNA and thereby
preventing it from binding to its target mRNAs (Figure 12.41e).
One such antisense RNA sequence targets the cellular miRNA­122
which is essential for the replication of hepatitis C virus (HCV) in the
human liver. This antisense RNA was the first to enter a clinical trial in

Chapter 12: Gene Regulation and Human Disease

any human disease and has shown promising effects in human patients
infected with HCV.
This antisense targeting of miRNAs can be modified by utilizing a longer
RNA which contains binding sites complementary to several different
miRNAs (Figure 12.41f ). This RNA can therefore act as a sponge, seques­
tering several different miRNAs which are involved in the disease process
and preventing them from inhibiting their target mRNAs. Interestingly, these
potential therapies mimic naturally occurring regulatory mechanisms in
which lncRNAs compete with mRNAs for binding of miRNAs, thereby mod­
ulating the effect of the miRNA on its target mRNAs (see Chapter 7, Section
7.7 and Chapter 11, Section 11.6).
As well as targeting miRNAs in these ways, it is also possible to target
lncRNAs which are involved in cancer (see Chapter 11, Section 11.6) and
other human diseases (see Section 12.4). One such case involves the
UBE3A gene, which is silenced on the paternal chromosome by the
process of imprinting (see Chapter 3, Section 3.6 for discussion of this
process). The maternal copy of the UBE3A gene remains active in normal
individuals (Figure 12.42a) but its deletion is responsible for the human
disease Angelman syndrome (Figure 12.42b). Individuals with this dis­
ease suffer from symptoms such as intellectual disability, epilepsy, and
impaired co­ordination even though they have a UBE3A gene on the
paternal chromosome which could encode a functional protein if the
gene was expressed.
A drug known as topotecan has been identified which can reactivate
expression of the silent UBE3A gene in an animal model of Angelman
disease. Most interestingly, topotecan appears to act by inhibiting the
expression of an lncRNA that is normally transcribed only on the paternal
chromosome in an antisense orientation relative to the UBE3A gene. This
relieves the inhibitory effect of this lncRNA and so induces expression of the
UBE3A gene (Figure 12.42c).
Evidently, such reactivation of a silenced but functional imprinted gene
represents a novel therapy for the human diseases caused by the deletion
of the normally active copy of this type of gene. Although the topotecan
example involves targeting an lncRNA, in view of the importance of chro­
matin structure in the imprinting process, it is likely that in future therapies
targeting silenced imprinted genes will be developed which involve manip­
ulation of epigenetic processes such as histone modification and DNA
methylation.
The examples discussed so far indicate the value of therapies involving
naturally occurring miRNAs or lncRNAs for therapeutic benefit. It is also
possible, however, to produce synthetic RNA molecules and use these to
artificially manipulate expression of a target gene in so­called RNA
­interference (RNAi) procedures. Thus, for example, short RNA molecules
which are complementary to a target mRNA can be produced and used to
inhibit it post­transcriptionally (Figure 12.43a) (see Chapter 1, Section 1.5
and Chapter 7, Section 7.7, for discussion of the mechanisms by which
small RNAs post­transcriptionally inhibit gene expression).
This approach has been used, for example, to prepare short RNAs
complementary to the mutant Huntingtin mRNA which is found in
Huntington’s disease (see Section 12.1). As these RNAs are complemen­
tary to the expanded triplet repeat sequence, they will not bind to the nor­
mal Huntingtin mRNA which lacks this sequence. They will therefore

In addition to utilizing such short RNA molecules it is possible also to
introduce into cells a DNA construct which expresses a long RNA molecule
complementary to the target RNA (Figure 12.43b). As discussed in
Chapter 1 (Section 1.5), the double­stranded RNA molecule formed in this
way acts as a substrate for the formation of siRNA molecules which then
bind to further copies of the target mRNA and induce its degradation.

CONCLUSIONS
As discussed in this chapter, many inherited human diseases are caused by
alterations in the processes which regulate gene expression at the level
of transcription, chromatin structure or post­transcriptional processes.
Similarly, infectious microorganisms target gene expression so as to
enhance the expression of their own genes or to overcome the defense
mechanisms of the host organism.
Ultimately, our enhanced understanding of the processes normally regu­
lating gene expression and the way they are altered in disease will lead to a
new generation of therapies for human diseases. Currently, many thousands
of patients take therapeutic drugs such as salicylate, FK506 or tamoxifen
which target transcription factors. However, all these drugs were isolated
on the basis of their efficacy and their mechanism of action was only deter­
mined subsequently. The identification of small molecules which can block
the p53/MDM2 interaction or manipulate epigenetic modifications such as
histone modifications or DNA methylation offers hope of a new generation

Therapeutic procedures involving artificial
inhibitory RNAs can involve small RNAs
complementary to the target mRNA which
bind to it and induce its degradation or block
its translation (a). Alternatively it can involve
longer RNAs which are complementary to
it and will therefore bind to it producing
a double-stranded RNA molecule. This

which can bind to further copies of the

of small molecule drugs which have been designed specifically to target
particular gene regulatory processes.
Such small molecules have the advantage that they can be delivered to
the body relatively easily. However, in many cases the specificity of their
effect will be a problem in that a drug targeting a particular enzyme such as
a histone acetyltransferase will need to be designed so as not to target other
similar enzymes. Moreover, even if this can be achieved, the individual tar­
geted enzyme may modulate the expression of many genes in addition to
these involved in the disease process.
An alternative group of methods therefore involve nucleic acid­based
therapies which can specifically target a particular gene. As discussed in
Section 12.6 this can involve delivering exogenous copies of the gene using
gene therapy procedures, specifically targeting the endogenous gene using
designer zinc fingers, using short DNA oligonucleotides to manipulate RNA
splicing, or using specific RNAs which are complementary to a target RNA
to inhibit it post­transcriptionally.
Although these methods can specifically target an individual gene, they
suffer from the general problems observed in all cases where it is necessary
to introduce nucleic acids into the body. Thus, injection of nucleic acids
either alone or packaged into fat particles known as liposomes very often
produces a very low delivery efficiency. This efficiency can be increased by
using viruses as delivery vehicles, but this raises safety issues necessitating
the partial disablement of the virus so it does not itself produce damaging
effects. It is often difficult to produce a virus with the optimum degree of
disablement so that it can deliver a nucleic acid effectively without produc­
ing damaging effects.
Hence, both small molecule and nucleic acid­based procedures have
their advantages and disadvantages in terms of manipulating gene regula­
tion for therapeutic benefit. Interestingly, gene regulatory processes are also
involved in cell­based therapies which offer an alternative to both small
molecule and nucleic acid­based therapies. These therapies were initially
developed based on the use of stem cells obtained from early human
embryos. As such cells have the potential to differentiate into many different
cell types, they could be used as a source of differentiated cells in diseases
where specific cell types are lost such as human neurodegenerative dis­
eases. However, obtaining human stem cells from early embryos raises sig­
nificant ethical issues, as well as difficulties in obtaining sufficient amounts
of material from the limited number of available embryos.
This has led to alternative approaches involving the generation of stem
cells from readily available differentiated adult cells. As described in Chapter
9 (Section 9.1) (see Figure 9.12), this involves using a cocktail of transcrip­
tion factors to reprogram the differentiated cells so that they can dedifferen­
tiate to produce stem cells which in turn can then redifferentiate into a
variety of cell types. Hence, gene regulatory processes are involved in cell­
based therapies as well as in those based on small molecules or nucleic acid
constructs.
Overall therefore, the very wide range of approaches described in this
chapter offers considerable hope of greatly improved therapies for diseases
involving abnormal gene regulation. Indeed, as described above, a number
of these approaches are being tested in clinical trials involving human
patients and several have passed this stage, and following approval by the
regulatory authorities are now being marketed and providing therapeutic
benefit in specific human diseases.

Conclusions and Future
Prospects
CONCLUSIONS AND FUTURE PROSPECTS
Transcription factors interact with one another to regulate
transcription
The extraordinary rate of progress in the study of eukaryotic gene control
processes can be gauged from the fact that by 1980, no transcriptional regulatory protein or its DNA-binding site in a regulated gene promoter had
been defined. Over the next decade however, tremendous advances were
made and a relatively clear picture of the action of individual factors which
regulate gene expression became available. For example, in the case of
gene induction by glucocorticoid or related hormones it was known that
these agents act by activating specific receptor proteins (Chapter 5, Section
5.1), that such activated receptors bind to specific DNA sequences upstream
of the target gene (Chapter 4, Section 4.3), displacing a nucleosome
(Chapter 3, Section 3.5) and that a region in the receptor protein then interacts with a factor bound to the TATA box to activate transcription (Chapter
5, Section 5.2).
Clearly therefore, the process by which a single agent can activate a
specific transcription factor and thereby modulate gene expression was reasonably well understood in outline by 1990. However, in subsequent years
it became increasingly clear that the activation of a single transcription factor by a single agent cannot be assessed in isolation. Rather, the activity of
a specific factor will depend upon its interaction with other transcription
factors as well as with other proteins. For example, glucocorticoid hormone
activates transcription by promoting the dissociation of the glucocorticoid
receptor from the inhibitory HSP90 protein which otherwise anchors it in
the cytoplasm and prevents it from moving to the nucleus and activating
transcription (Chapter 8, Section 8.1).
A similar example of protein–protein interactions regulating transcription factor activity but in the opposite direction is observed in the Fos and
Jun proteins which regulate gene expression in response to growth factor or
phorbol ester treatment (Chapter 11, Section 11.2). As discussed in Chapter
5 (Section 5.1), the Fos protein cannot bind to DNA on its own but can do so
only after forming a heterodimer with the Jun protein. This heterodimer
then binds to DNA and activates transcription. In this case, the interaction
with another protein allows Fos to activate transcription, whereas in the
case of the glucocorticoid receptor the interaction with HSP90 has the opposite effect.
Such types of protein–protein interactions regulating transcription factor
activation are not confined to the regulation of gene expression by shortterm inducers but are also involved in the regulation of cell type- and tissuespecific gene expression. For example, as discussed in Chapter 10 (Section
10.1), the MyoD transcription factor plays a key role in regulating muscle

13

458

Chapter 13: Conclusions and Future Prospects

cell-specific gene expression and thereby in producing differentiated skeletal muscle cells. MyoD can bind to the promoters of muscle-specific genes
and activate their expression, thereby causing the differentiation of a fibroblast cell line into muscle cells.
The production of differentiated skeletal muscle cells in this situation
requires, however, that the cells are cultured in the absence of growth factors. In the presence of growth factor, the cells contain high levels of the
inhibitory factor Id which heterodimerizes with MyoD and prevents it binding to DNA and activating transcription (see Chapter 5, Section 5.3). The
production of the skeletal muscle phenotype therefore requires not only
high levels of the activating MyoD protein but also a fall in the levels of the
inhibitory Id protein which occurs upon growth factor removal.
It is clear therefore that in families of transcription factors which are
capable of dimerization by means of specific motifs such as the leucine zipper or helix-loop-helix (see Chapter 5, Section 5.1), such dimerization with
another member of the family can result in activation (Fos–Jun) or repression (MyoD–Id).

Transcription factors can repress gene expression
as well as activating it
The Id example also illustrates another theme which is of great importance
in gene regulation, namely the importance of specific inhibition as opposed
to activation of gene expression (see Chapter 5, Section 5.3). As well as
transcription factors such as the Id factor which function only as inhibitors,
cases also exist where the same factor can function as a direct activator or
repressor depending on the circumstances. This is seen in the case of the
thyroid hormone receptor which unlike the glucocorticoid receptor binds to
its DNA target site even in the absence of hormone. As discussed in Chapter
5 (Section 5.3), this factor can directly inhibit promoter activity in the
absence of thyroid hormone whereas in the presence of thyroid hormone
it undergoes a conformational change which allows it to activate gene
expression.

DNA-binding transcription factors interact with co-activators/
co-repressors and with regulators of chromatin structure
The case of the thyroid hormone receptor illustrates two of the major
themes to have emerged in recent years from further study of gene control
processes, namely the role of co-repressor/co-activator molecules (see
Chapter 5) and the influence of transcription factors on chromatin structure
(see Chapters 2 and 3). As discussed in Chapter 5 (Section 5.3), the inhibitory domain of the thyroid hormone receptor acts indirectly by recruiting an
inhibitory molecule known as the nuclear receptor co-repressor which
actually produces the inhibitory effect. Although this factor may interact
directly with the basal transcriptional complex, it has also been shown to
itself recruit another molecule which has the ability to deacetylate histones.
As such histone deacetylation is associated with a tightly packed chromatin
structure incompatible with transcription (see Chapter 3, Section 3.3), the
inhibitory effect of the thyroid hormone receptor appears to be mediated, at
least in part, by the ability of its co-repressor to recruit a molecule that can
organize the chromatin into a nontranscribable form.
As discussed in Chapter 5 (Section 5.3), the addition of thyroid hormone
results in a conformational change in the thyroid hormone receptor which
causes the release of its co-repressor and allows the receptor to activate
transcription. Interestingly, as with transcriptional repression by the receptor, such activation requires a co-factor and involves alterations in histone
acetylation. Following exposure to thyroid hormone, the thyroid hormone
receptor can bind the CBP co-activator. This factor was originally identified
as a co-activator which binds to the CREB transcription factor (see Chapter
5, Section 5.2 and Chapter 8, Section 8.2) but was subsequently shown to be
involved in transcriptional activation by nuclear receptors, such as the glucocorticoid receptor and the thyroid hormone receptor.

CONCLUSIONS AND FUTURE PROSPECTS
As discussed in Chapter 5 (Section 5.2), CBP is able to act as a coactivator by interacting with components of the basal transcriptional
complex to stimulate its activity. In addition however, it also has histone
acetyltransferase activity (see Chapter 2, Section 2.3 and Chapter 3,
Section 3.3) indicating that by acetylating histones it can reverse the effects
of the nuclear receptor/co-repressor complex and convert the chromatin
into a form where transcription can occur. The addition of thyroid hormone therefore converts the thyroid hormone receptor from a form which
can bind an inhibitory co-repressor complex with histone deacetylase
activity to a form where it can bind a stimulatory co-activator with histone
acetyltransferase activity.
This example therefore indicates the importance of co-activators and
co-repressors, as well as providing a critical link between the transcription
factors discussed in Chapter 5 and the chromatin structure changes discussed in Chapter 3.
Such an interplay between the control of transcription itself and the regulation of chromatin structure is also well illustrated by an analysis of the
processes which regulate gene expression during embryonic development
(see Chapter 9). For example, in Drosophila, many of the factors regulating
gene expression have been defined using a genetic approach involving the
isolation of mutant flies exhibiting abnormal development and the subsequent characterization of the regulatory protein encoded by each mutated
gene (see Chapter 9, Section 9.2).
In a number of such cases the proteins identified in this way encode
DNA-binding transcription factors such as the homeodomain factors which
can bind to DNA and then activate or repress transcription (see Chapter 5,
Section 5.1 and Chapter 9, Section 9.2). In contrast, however, other proteins
identified in this way encode factors that regulate the chromatin structure of
their target genes. For example, polycomb factors act to produce a more
tightly packed chromatin structure incompatible with transcription, whereas
this effect is opposed by trithorax proteins which open up the chromatin
structure allowing transcription to occur.
Interestingly, the chromatin structure and hence the transcription of the
genes encoding the homeodomain factors themselves are subject to regulation by the polycomb and trithorax proteins (see Chapter 5, Section 5.1).
This indicates that specific regulatory proteins can control the expression
of other regulatory proteins, as well as regulating target genes encoding
proteins with other functions. Moreover, although originally identified in
Drosophila, both homeodomain proteins and the polycomb/trithorax proteins have subsequently been identified in a wide range of other organisms,
including mammals, where they play a key role in the regulation of gene
expression (see for example, Chapter 9, Sections 9.1 and 9.3).

H
The key role played by changes in chromatin structure has led to intensive
investigation of the manner in which regulatory proteins can alter the structure of chromatin. It is now clear that the post-translational modification of
histones by transcriptional regulators is a key event in the modulation of
chromatin structure, leading to transcriptional activation or repression.
As discussed in Chapter 3 (Section 3.3), such histone modifications
include not only acetylation but also methylation, phosphorylation, ubiquitination, and sumoylation. For example, the effects of polycomb and
trithorax proteins on chromatin structure involve specific modifications of
histones, with the polycomb complex methylating histones on the lysines
at positions 9 and 27 in histone H3 which promotes a more tightly packed
chromatin structure. In contrast, the trithorax proteins promote the methylation of histone H3 on lysine 4 which in turn promotes demethylation at
positions 9 and 27 (see Chapter 3, Section 3.3).
The various histone modifications can interact with one another so that
the existence of one modification at a particular amino acid influences

459

460

Chapter 13: Conclusions and Future Prospects

positively or negatively the occurrence of another modification at another
amino acid. This has led to the idea of a “histone code” in which a particular
pattern of modification on the histones, in a particular region of DNA, promotes or inhibits the changes necessary for transcription to occur by affecting the recruitment of chromatin-remodeling complexes (see Chapter 3,
Section 3.5) and DNA-binding transcriptional activators or repressors.

Co-activators/co-repressors link together different signaling
pathways by interacting with multiple transcription factors
Interestingly, a number of co-activator/co-repressor molecules appear to
interact, respectively, with multiple different activating or inhibitory transcription factors. In the case of the CBP co-activator which is used by
transcription factors activated by different signaling pathways, this has
been shown to result in interactions between these pathways. For example, both the glucocorticoid receptor which is activated by glucocorticoid
and the AP1 (Fos–Jun) complex which is activated by phorbol esters
require the CBP co-activator to mediate this stimulatory effect on gene
transcription (see Chapter 5, Section 5.2). Because CBP levels in the cell
are relatively low, when both pathways are activated simultaneously they
will compete for the limited amount of CBP and neither pathway will be
able to activate transcription. Hence, the requirement of both of these
pathways for CBP results in a mutual inhibition of gene activation by each
of these factors (Chapter 8, Section 8.1).
This example illustrates how the effect of one signaling pathway can be
affected by the activation of another signaling pathway. In the absence of
glucocorticoid hormone, the glucocorticoid receptor will be anchored in the
cytoplasm by HSP90 and the Fos–Jun complex will be able to interact with
CBP and activate gene expression in response to growth factors or phorbol
esters. However, when the glucocorticoid receptor is freed from HSP90 by
the presence of glucocorticoid it can interact with CBP, removing it from
Fos–Jun and preventing them activating gene expression.
This is seen in the case of the gene encoding the collagenase enzyme
which is activated by the Fos–Jun complex in response to phorbol esters and
can produce severe tissue destruction in an inflamed area. As expected on
the basis of the above model, the activation of this gene by phorbol esters is
inhibited by treatment with glucocorticoid hormone, accounting for the
anti-inflammatory effort of this steroid hormone. Conversely, the activation
of glucocorticoid-responsive genes by hormone treatment will be inhibited
by the presence of high levels of Fos and Jun induced by growth factor or
phorbol ester treatment, since they will compete for the limited amount of
available CBP (see Chapter 8, Section 8.1).
These examples indicate therefore that the effect of a particular factor
on gene expression will depend on the nature of the other factors present
in the cell and the state of activation of specific signaling pathways. Indeed,
as discussed in Chapter 8, the activity of many transcription factors is
modulated by specific signaling pathways. Such pathways can enhance or
reduce the activity of a particular transcription factor by, for example, regulating its association with another protein, its post-translational modification or its processing from a precursor protein. Such modifications can
affect co-activators as well as DNA-binding transcriptional activators. For
example, phosphorylation of the CBP co-activator by the IκB kinase
enhances its binding to NFκB while reducing its binding to p53 (see Chapter
8, Section 8.2). The balance between different pathways which use the
same co-activator can therefore be modulated either by modifying the
activator itself or by modifying a co-activator.
It is clear therefore that our simple picture of the glucocorticoid receptor acting in isolation has to be modified to consider its inhibition by interaction with HSP90, as well as its need to recruit other factors in order to
stimulate transcription. Such factors include CBP and, as discussed in
Chapter 3 (Section 3.5), the SWI/SNF complex which also reorganizes
chromatin structure.

CONCLUSIONS AND FUTURE PROSPECTS

Gene regulation is highly complex and involves both
transcriptional and post-transcriptional regulation
Over the last few years it has become clear therefore that the regulation of a
single gene in an intact cell is vastly more complex than could be predicted
from the study of an isolated transcription factor interacting with its binding
site. At first sight it may appear that recent progress in this area has merely
complicated the issue. However, the process of gene regulation must not
only produce all the different types of cells in the body (see Chapter 10) but
also ensure that each cell type is produced in the right place and at the right
time during development (see Chapter 9).
It is inevitable therefore that gene regulation must be a highly complex
process, with numerous factors interacting with each other and their
respective DNA-binding sites to regulate chromatin structure and/or
directly regulate the transcription of specific genes in specific cell types.
Moreover, such control of transcription is significantly supplemented by
post-transcriptional control processes (see Chapters 6 and 7). These
include processes such as RNA splicing or RNA editing which can produce
multiple mRNAs encoding related proteins from a single gene. For example, over 90% of human genes which contain multiple introns are subject
to alternative RNA splicing. Similarly, transcriptional control is supplemented by other post-transcriptional processes such as the regulation of
mRNA stability or of mRNA translation which can produce a rapid change
in protein levels in response to changing conditions. Moreover, the processes which control transcriptional initiation and elongation interact with
post-transcriptional processes such as capping, splicing, and polyadenylation to ensure that the final mRNA is produced in an effective and coordinated manner (see Chapter 6, Section 6.4).

Both small and large noncoding RNAs play a central role
in regulating gene expression
It is clear therefore that specific regulatory proteins play key roles in the regulation of gene expression, acting by altering chromatin structure, by controlling transcription itself or by regulating post-transcriptional processes.
However, the last few years have seen the realization that these gene control processes are also regulated by specific RNA molecules. Small inhibitory
RNA molecules between 20 and 30 bases in length such as siRNAs, miRNAs,
and piRNAs have now been extensively characterized (see Chapter 1,
Section 1.5) and shown to be involved in, for example, the control of developmentally regulated (Chapter 9) and cell type-specific gene expression
(Chapter 10).
Interestingly, small RNAs can repress gene expression both by
altering chromatin structure (see Chapter 3, Section 3.4) and at the posttranscriptional levels of mRNA degradation and mRNA translation (see
Chapter 7, Section 7.7). Moreover, as well as regulating expression of structural genes encoding proteins with diverse functions in the cell, they can
also regulate the expression of genes which themselves encode regulatory
proteins such as transcription factors or alternative splicing factors. In turn,
such alteration in the expression of regulatory proteins will obviously have
effects on the expression of the downstream target genes for such regulatory proteins. This not only greatly increases the regulatory effects of the
small RNAs but allows them to have positive as well as negative effects on
gene expression. For example, by inhibiting the expression of an inhibitory
transcription factor, a small RNA can neutralize the inhibitory effect of the
transcription factor on its target genes, so resulting in gene activation (see
for example, Chapter 7, Section 7.7 and Chapter 10, Section 10.2).
As well as such small RNAs, many long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) of
over 200 bases in length have been identified (see Chapter 1, Section 1.5)
and shown to play a critical role in regulating gene expression. For example, an lncRNA is transcribed from an enhancer element that regulates the
expression of the gene encoding the MyoD muscle-specific transcription
factor. The transcription of this lncRNA is essential for the changes in

461

462

Chapter 13: Conclusions and Future Prospects

chromatin structure of the MyoD gene promoter which allow this gene to be
transcribed in muscle cells (see Chapter 10, Section 10.1). Similarly, an
lncRNA has been shown to regulate the differentiation of human monocytes
into dendritic cells by binding to the STAT3 transcription factor and promoting its activation by phosphorylation (see Chapter 8, Section 8.2 for discussion of STAT factors and their activation).
In addition, specific lncRNAs are involved in the processes of gene
imprinting, while the XIST RNA whose transcription from one X chromosome silences all other genes on that chromosome plays a critical role in
X-chromosome inactivation (see Chapter 3, Section 3.6). These examples
indicate that in contrast to the generally inhibitory effect of small RNAs,
different lncRNA molecules can either activate or repress gene expression.
It is clear therefore that as well as regulatory proteins, regulatory RNAs
are involved in controlling gene expression. Indeed, the ENCODE project
analyzing the functional elements in the human genome (see Chapter 1,
Section 1.4 and Chapter 4, Section 4.3) found that approximately threequarters of the human genome is transcribed into RNA. Only a small proportion of the RNAs produced by such transcription can encode proteins and
much of the remaining transcribed DNA is likely to encode regulatory RNAs.
Like the RNA derived from the MyoD gene enhancer, many lncRNAs are
derived from enhancer elements or from other regulatory DNA sequences
which regulate the expression of a protein-coding gene but are located outside its transcribed region. As such they are likely to play a role in controlling the access of DNA-binding proteins to these sequences.
However, many other lncRNAs which have been identified in the
ENCODE project overlap regions which are transcribed to produce protein-coding RNAs. Moreover, they are frequently transcribed from the opposite strand of the DNA to that producing the protein-coding mRNA. They
could therefore potentially regulate expression of the protein-coding RNA,
for example, by allowing the production of a double-stranded RNA that
could generate inhibitory siRNAs (see Chapter 1, Section 1.5). In other situations, the transcription of an lncRNA from the opposite strand to that producing the protein-coding mRNA can alter the chromatin structure of this
DNA region, thereby regulating the expression of the protein-coding RNA
(see Chapter 3, Section 3.4).
Interestingly, as well as interacting directly with mRNAs, lncRNAs can
also interact with small RNAs to regulate their activity. Thus, as described in
Chapter 7 (Section 7.7), linear or circular lncRNAs can contain binding sites
for miRNAs and thereby act as molecular sponges, sequestering these
miRNAs and preventing them binding to and inhibiting their mRNA targets.

Regulatory elements, chromatin structure, and DNA-binding
proteins can be mapped across entire genomes
As noted above, the MyoD gene enhancer is transcribed to produce an
lncRNA which plays an important role in the activation of MyoD gene
expression. Most importantly, recent data have indicated that transcription
to produce an lncRNA is a characteristic of enhancers, with such transcription occurring in situations where the enhancer is active (see Chapter 4,
Section 4.4 for detailed discussion of enhancers). As in the case of the MyoD
enhancer, such transcription is likely to facilitate DNA looping, allowing the
enhancer to interact with its target promoter and facilitate its activation via
alteration of its chromatin structure and/or the recruitment of specific DNAbinding proteins.
This association between production of lncRNAs from an enhancer and
the activity of the enhancer (i.e. its ability to activate its target gene in a specific cell type) is now so strong that it has been used by the FANTOM 5 project to produce a map of active enhancer elements across the entire human
genome and to compare this map in a wide variety of different cell types.
As well as characterizing enhancer elements in this manner, the
FANTOM 5 consortium has also mapped transcriptional start sites (TSS)
across the entire human genome, so allowing promoter elements adjacent

CONCLUSIONS AND FUTURE PROSPECTS
to such TSS to be characterized and their activity analyzed in different cell
types (see Chapter 4, Section 4.3 for detailed description of gene promoters).
Taken together therefore these methods allow the complete analysis of regulatory sequences in the DNA and their activity in different cell types.
In turn, the mechanisms producing the differential activity of promoters
and enhancers can also be analyzed at a whole genome level. Thus, for
example, the ENCODE consortium used high-throughput methods to analyze the chromatin structure of the human genome in different cell types at
the level of nucleosome positioning (see Chapter 2, Section 2.2), DNA methylation (see Chapter 3, Section 3.2), histone modification (see Chapter 3,
Section 3.3), and DNaseI hypersensitive sites (see Chapter 3, Section 3.5).
Evidently, such changes in the structure of chromatin will affect the ability of specific transcription factors to bind to their binding sites. As described
in Chapter 4 (Section 4.3), such binding can also be analyzed at the genome
level using the ChIP technique, so linking together chromatin structure and
promoter/enhancer activity.
In turn, the net result of such alterations in the activity of regulatory elements will be alterations in the transcription of particular DNA sequences
resulting in the expression of specific RNAs. The entire population of RNAs
in different tissues or cell lines can be analyzed, for example, by gene chip
analysis as described in Chapter 1 (Section 1.2) and then correlated with
chromatin structure gene, the transcription factors bound to the corresponding DNA, and promoter/enhancer activity. More recently, such transcriptomic analysis has been carried out at an individual cell level within,
for example, the prenatal human brain, using both in situ hybridization (see
Chapter 1, Section 1.2) and the laser dissection of a very small amount of
tissue followed by microarray analysis of its RNA transcripts.

H
The high-throughput methods discussed above can now be linked together
to build a full picture of gene control processes. Thus, following the initial
production of the first full human DNA sequence by the human genome project, it is now possible to rapidly obtain the genome sequence of any species
or individual by high-throughput DNA sequencing (Figure 13.1a). As discussed above and in Chapters 2 and 3, such analysis can be extended to a
full analysis of the epigenome by characterizing, for example, DNA methylation and histone modifications across the entire genome (Figure 13.1b).
Moreover, as discussed in Chapters 2 and 3, such epigenetic changes
play a critical role in determining the chromatin structure of the genome and
this can be further analyzed at a genome level by nucleosome-positioning
analysis and identification of DNAse1 hypersensitive sites (Figure 13.1c).
In turn, the chromatin structure will determine whether DNA-binding
proteins can bind to a particular DNA region, leading to changes in the
activity of DNA regulatory elements such as promoters and enhancers. As
noted above and in Chapters 4 and 5, both the location of DNA-binding proteins and the activity of promoters and enhancers can also now be mapped
across the entire genome (Figure 13.1d).
These effects will then result in the transcription of a specific set of RNAs
in a given cell type. Subsequently, post-transcriptional processes (see
Chapters 6 and 7), will result in a specific population of mRNAs and other
RNA molecules in each individual cell type (Figure 13.1e). This will in turn,
allow the final stage of gene expression, namely the production of the specific proteins required by a given cell type (Figure 13.1f ) to allow it to
perform its specific functions (Figure 13.1g). The RNA and protein populations of specific cell types can be analyzed, respectively, by the gene chip
and proteomic methods described in Chapter 1.

Gene control is necessarily a highly complex process

different cell types, organs, individuals, or species. The greater our understanding of this process becomes, the more complex it appears. However,
understanding this complexity will ultimately indicate how gene regulation can control the highly complex processes of cellular signaling
(see Chapter 8), embryonic development (see Chapter 9), and the production of different cell types (see Chapter 10).
Indeed, the processes of gene control are much more complex than the
simple linear pathways indicated in Figure 13.1, since many of the proteins
whose expression is regulated by the processes illustrated will themselves
encode regulatory proteins able to influence the chromatin structure or the
transcriptional and post-transcriptional regulation of a number of different
target genes. This leads to the existence of regulatory networks of the type
illustrated in Figure 9.67, in which multiple regulatory proteins and RNAs
regulate the expression of each other and of downstream targets encoding
structural proteins. These networks are increasingly being characterized
by a combination of experimental and computer-based techniques and
understanding them will be critical for our understanding of complex processes such as embryonic development and cellular differentiation.
In general therefore, a variety of different analyses indicate the enormous complexity of gene regulatory processes. Nonetheless, the enormous
progress in understanding gene regulation in terms of factor–factor interactions, changes in chromatin structure, identification of regulatory RNAs,
whole genome analysis, and elucidation of gene regulatory networks, etc.,
which has taken place in the last few years indicates that an understanding
of the ultimate problem of mammalian development in terms of differential
gene expression can eventually be achieved. Similarly, our enhanced understanding of the role of aberrant gene regulation in cancer and other human
diseases (see Chapters 11 and 12) offers hope of improved therapies for
such diseases based on the artificial manipulation of gene expression in
human patients.

see vascular endothelial growth factor

VHL von Hippel Lindau anti-oncoprotein (tumor
suppressor protein) which is involved in regulating
the stability of other proteins.
virus Particle consisting of nucleic acid (RNA or DNA)
enclosed in a protein coat and capable of replicating only
within a host cell and then spreading from cell to cell.
Western blotting (immunoblotting) Technique by
which proteins are separated by electrophoresis and
immobilized on a paper sheet and then analyzed, usually by means of a labeled antibody.
white blood cell (leucocyte) General name for all
the nucleated blood cells lacking hemoglobin. Includes
lymphocytes, granulocytes, and monocytes.

wobble effect Ability of several different codons in
the mRNA to bind to the same anticodon in a tRNA and
therefore direct insertion of the same amino acid into the
protein.
X chromosome One of the two sex chromosomes of
mammals. The cells of women contain two X chromosomes, while those of men contain only one.
Xenopus laevis Species of frog frequently used in
studies of early vertebrate development.
XIC

see X-inactivation center

X inactivation Inactivation of one copy of the X chromosome in the somatic cells of female mammals.
X-inactivation center (XIC) Site in an X chromosome
at which inactivation is initiated and spreads outwards.
XIST Long noncoding RNA whose transcription initiates in the X-inactivation center and which is critical
for the process of X-inactivation.
X-ray crystallography (X-ray diffraction) Technique
for determining the three-dimensional arrangement of
atoms in a molecule such as a protein based on the diffraction pattern of X-rays passing through a crystal of the
molecule.
Y chromosome One of the two sex chromosomes of
mammals. The cells of men contain one Y and one X
chromosome.
yeast Common name for several families of unicellular fungi. Includes species used for brewing and
bread-making, as well as pathogenic species. Among the
simplest of eukaryotes.
zebrafish A fish which is widely used as a model
organism for the study of vertebrate development.
zigzag ribbon Potential structure of the 30 nm chromatin fiber in which nucleosomes are thrown into a
double helical structure. See also solenoid.
zinc finger DNA-binding structural motifs present in
many gene regulatory proteins. All zinc finger motifs
incorporate one or more zinc atoms that help hold the
protein conformation together. In one type of finger, the
zinc atom is bound by two cysteine and two histidine
amino acids. In the other type of finger it is bound by
multiple cysteine amino acids.
zygote Diploid cell produced by fusion of a male and
female gamete. A fertilized egg.
